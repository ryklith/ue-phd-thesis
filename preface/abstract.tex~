This thesis is concerned with the energy efficiency of cellular networks. It studies the dominant power consumer in future cellular networks, the \ac{LTE} radio \ac{BS}, and proposes mechanisms that enhance the \ac{BS} energy efficiency by reducing its power consumption under target rate constraints. These mechanisms trade spare capacity for power saving.

First, the thesis describes how much power individual components of a \ac{BS} consume and what parameters affect this consumption based on third party experimental data. These individual models are joined into a component power model for an entire \ac{BS}. The component model is an essential step in analysis but is too complex for many applications. It is therefore abstracted into a much simpler parameterized model to reduce its complexity. The parameterized model is further simplified into an affine model which can be applied in power minimization.

Second, \ac{PC} and \ac{DTX} are identified as promising power-saving \ac{RRM} mechanisms and applied to multi-user downlink transmission. \ac{PC} reduces the power consumption of the \ac{PA} and is found to be most effective at high traffic loads. DTX mostly reduces the power consumption of the \ac{BB} unit while interrupting transmission and is better applied in low traffic loads. Joint optimization of these two techniques is found to enable additional power-saving at medium traffic loads and to be a convex problem which can be solved efficiently. The convex problem is extended to provide a comprehensive power-saving \ac{OFDMA} frame resource scheduler. The proposed scheduler is shown to reduce power consumption by 25-40\% in computer simulations, depending on the traffic load.

Finally, the thesis investigates the influence of interference on power consumption in a network of multiple power-saving \acp{BS}. It discusses three popular alternative distributed uncoordinated methods which align \ac{DTX} mode between neighboring \acp{BS}. To address drawbacks of these three, a fourth memory-based \ac{DTX} alignment method is proposed. It decreases power consumption by up to 40\% and retransmission probability by around 20\%, depending on the traffic load.

% Ever increasing mobile data demands lead to the deployment of ever denser cellular networks. Coupled with rising energy prices, this causes steeply growing electricity bills for mobile network operators. To counter this effect, the work in this thesis aims to reduce the power consumption of cellular networks. As \acp{BS} consume the largest share of electricity in cellular networks, they are the focus of this work. To provide results which are relevant for and applicable to the coming generation of cellular networks, solutions are provided particularly for \ac{LTE} networks. Focus is the reduction of the power consumption in \ac{LTE} \acp{BS} without making a compromise in the \ac{QoS} for users. Room for exploitation is offered by the fact that cellular networks are rarely fully loaded. Especially load decreases over the course of a day can be exploited for power saving. As a first step, the components of a modern \ac{BS} are inspected and sources of power consumption are identified. The component power consumption is documented to provide a detailed power model of an \ac{LTE} \ac{BS}. Since this model is too complex for most research applications, it is abstracted and parameterized to cover only the three most important characteristics of power consumption in a \ac{BS}: that the \ac{PA} causes significant power consumption due to the high transmission powers and low efficiencies involved; that sleep modes allow further abating the power consumption of a \ac{BS}; and that, due to the \ac{MIMO} \ac{BS} complexity, the adaptation of the number of transmission antennas also represents a promising power-saving mechanism. While the parameterized model requires significantly fewer input parameters compared to the component model, it has to be further simplified into a model which can be employed in mathematical analysis. The result is an affine model which assumes defaults for all but three parameters, but can be employed in optimization in later chapters. The macro two-antenna \ac{BS} in this model is quantified at a maximum consumption of 460.7\,W per sector with a sleep mode consumption of 216\,W per sector. The affine model and prior findings are used to develop \ac{PC} and sleep techniques which are first employed individually and later jointly. To avoid issues with latency, a very short sleep mode called \ac{DTX} is applied. It is found that \ac{PC} is best suited for high loads when transmission power is high compared to other sources of consumption. \ac{DTX} provides strong benefits at low loads when \acp{BS} can be set to sleep for significant parts of a transmission frame. When employed jointly, power consumption can be reduced even at medium loads. The joint optimization of \ac{PC} and \ac{DTX} is combined with \ac{AA} into a comprehensive \ac{OFDMA} power saving resource scheduler. This scheduler is based on a simplified convex problem which is then generalized. It is shown to achieve a 25-40\% decrease in power consumption for macro \acp{BS}. Finally, the single cell findings are extended to the multi-cell interference environment which opens additional room for exploitation. By aligning the \ac{DTX} slots of interfering \acp{BS} constructively, interference can be reduced and energy efficiency increased. Four alternative alignment schemes are compared, one of which is an original contribution. The dynamic nature of distributed interference alignment necessitates a trade-off between power savings and user satisfaction. While conservative alignment provides the highest satisfaction at the highest power cost, the proposed memory-based \ac{DTX} alignment scheme provides the most effective trade--off and  reduces power consumption by \mbox{30-50\%} at the cost of a slight decrease in user satisfaction.
