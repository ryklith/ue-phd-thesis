The four strategies were tested ...
\subsubsection{Power Consumption}
To assess achievable power savings and the dynamic adaptivity over a large range of cell loads, the cell total power consumption is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sumrate}. %With ten users per cell, the cell loads range from 10~Mbps to 30~Mbps. 
At low load very few resource blocks are required to deliver the target rate and more time slots can be scheduled for \ac{DTX} than at high traffic loads, leading to monotonously rising power consumption over increasing target rates for all alignment methods. 

Sequential alignment causes the highest power consumption over any target rate with an almost linear relationship between user target rates and power consumption. Sequential alignment consumes high power, as it schedules many resource blocks to achieve the target rate due to the high interference level present. 

This power consumption is significantly lower for the \ac{SOTA}, random alignment. The randomness of time slot alignment creates a much lower average interference than with sequential alignment allowing more data to be transmitted in each resource block. As fewer resource blocks are required, less power is consumed.

P-persistent ranking and \ac{DTX} with memory both achieve similarly low power consumption of up to 40\% less than random alignment. The relationship between power consumption and target rate is noticeably non-linear, as it is flat at low target rates and grows more steeply at high target rates. This behavior is caused by the low interference level these strategies manage to create. Only at high rates, when the number of sleep time slots has to be significantly decreased, does the interference increase, leading to higher power consumption.

Also noteworthy is the fact that at 1~Mbps and 3~Mbps, random alignment performs nearly as good as p-persistent ranking. At these extreme points the network is almost unloaded and almost fully loaded, respectively. Consequently, either most time slots are scheduled for \ac{DTX} or none, leaving very little room for optimization compared to randomness. The largest potential for time slot alignment for power saving is in networks which are medium loaded. Under medium load, the number of transmission and \ac{DTX} time slots is similar, causing the effects of alignment to be most pronounced.
