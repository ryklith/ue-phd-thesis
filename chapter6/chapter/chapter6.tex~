\section{Summary and Conclusions}
In this thesis, the power consumption of \ac{LTE} \ac{BS} devices was studied and modelled. The findings from the model were applied to reduce power consumption through energy efficient \ac{RRM} mechanisms while upholding user rate constraints. \ac{RRM} mechanisms were applied to control links on the cell level and interference on the multi-cell level.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction}, the importance of energy efficiency for current mobile networks was emphasized. As mobile traffic, the number of devices and the size of the infrastructure are constantly increasing, the \coo~emission of mobile networks is expected to double between 2007 and 2020. Green Radio research efforts, such as this thesis, are directed to revert that trend. 

Chapter~\ref{ch:motivation} first inspected the power consumption life cycle of a mobile network. While the production of mobile equipment causes significant emissions of \coo, the operation is power efficient. The situation was found to be almost the opposite for cellular \acp{BS} which cause the largest share of emissions during operation. This is caused by the significant number of stations in operation combined with their long life times. This situation motivated the reduction of operation power consumption of \acp{BS} as the topic of this thesis. Next, the \ac{SOTA} of Green Radio was identified through a detailed literature survey. Finally, the chapter also discussed fundamental technical concepts in preparation for the original contributions in Chapters~\ref{ch:device}, \ref{ch:cell}, and \ref{ch:network}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:device} explored the sources of power consumption in an \ac{LTE} \ac{BS}. First,  the difficulty of accurate power modeling and other existing power models were described. Next, the typical architecture of a \ac{BS} was introduced. Each of its components was discussed and individually modelled. Components were found to be either load adaptive, like the \ac{PA} and \ac{BB} unit, have constant power consumption, like the \ac{RF} transceiver, or have a power consumption which scales with other components' consumption, like power conversion and cooling. The power consumptions of the subcomponents were combined to find the power consumption of the entire \ac{BS}. Since the component model is too elaborate for many applications, a parameterized model was proposed which abstracts many parameters. The parameterized model only considers those parameters which are typically modified during operation such as bandwidth, transmission power, the number of transmission antennas, and sleep mode. Parameters were provided. The parameterized model was once more simplified into an affine model which can be applied in optimization. Overall, it was found that an increase of the energy efficiency in \acp{BS} must be based on reducing the \ac{PA} power consumption through \ac{PC} and setting the entire \ac{BS} to a sleep mode. Hardware research should focus on enabling and amplifying these two mechanisms. Other manipulation such as the adaptation of coding, modulation or bandwidth are less promising. Simple models are found to capture the most relevant aspects sufficiently. 

With the power model and saving techniques identified in the prior chapter, Chapter~\ref{ch:cell} explored three \ac{RRM} mechanisms to reduce \ac{BS} power consumption. The first technique is \ac{PC}, through which power was adapted to match only the requested capacity per \ac{UE} instead of over-achieving. The second technique is \ac{DTX}, a very short sleep mode. Of the two, \ac{PC} was found to provide strong savings in high load when transmission power is generally high, whereas \ac{DTX} was most effective at low load when there is ample opportunity for sleep mode. It was shown that the joint application of \ac{PC} and \ac{DTX} achieves lower power consumption than either individual technique over all cell traffic loads in the \ac{PRAIS} scheme. This joint problem was shown to be convex and thus efficiently solvable. This finding was combined with the third technique, \ac{AA}, and applied by using it as the core of a power-saving \ac{MIMO} \ac{OFDMA} resource scheduler, called \ac{RAPS}. \ac{RAPS} first solves a simplified convex real-valued subproblem. The solution of the subproblem is then quantized to the integer-valued \ac{OFDMA} scheduling problem and joined with subcarrier allocation and power allocation. \ac{AA} was found to provide little added value on top of the other two techniques. Application of \ac{RAPS} was shown to reduce power consumption of \ac{LTE} \acp{BS} by 25-40\% in single-cell simulation. \ac{RAPS} could be readily built into current \ac{LTE} \acp{BS}. 

Going beyond the cell level, Chapter~\ref{ch:network} studied the exploration of intercell interference for power saving. It is beneficial to align the \ac{DTX} mode of \acp{BS} constructively, to the effect that interference is reduced. Four alternative alignment techniques have been tested in simulation: sequential alignment, random alignment, p-persistent ranking, and distributed \ac{DTX} with memory. The latter is an original contribution by the author. Sequential alignment is a conservative technique which maximizes interference for the benefit of predictability. Random alignment is assumed was the \ac{SOTA}. P-persistent ranking is a popular technique for the suppression of oscillation. Distributed \ac{DTX} with memory goes further and keeps track of past allocations and channel quality to enable convergence to a stable network state. The important finding was that---unlike for the single cell in Chapter~\ref{ch:cell}---the power consumption could not be reduced through these mechanisms without affecting the \ac{QoS}. The interference dynamics cause occasional violations of the rate constraints, thus necessitating retransmissions. Random alignment caused regular rate constraint violations at medium power consumption. P-persistent ranking was slightly more reliable with lower retransmission probability at low power consumption. However, distributed \ac{DTX} with memory provided a much lower retransmission probability than p-persistent ranking at lower power consumption. It thus provided the best best retransmission probability and power saving. The power saving of distributed \ac{DTX} with memory over the \ac{SOTA} was found to be up to 40\%, depending on the cell loads.

In conclusion, this thesis provides three readily applicable supply power models for \ac{LTE} \acp{BS}, including the model derivations. From these models, \ac{DTX} and \ac{PC} were identified as most effective and applied to reduce \ac{BS} operating power consumption. \ac{PC} and \ac{DTX} were optimized jointly and integrated into a comprehensive \ac{MIMO} \ac{OFDMA} scheduler. The inherent \ac{DTX} time slots of such a scheduler were then aligned constructively between neighbouring \acp{BS}. Reducing \ac{BS} power consumption by 50\% through software is thus well within reach.

\section{Limitations and Future Work}
The most important limitation to the techniques proposed in this thesis lies in the restrictions imposed on the scheduler by a transmission standard like \ac{LTE}. In this research, it was assumed that a scheduler can select any resource block for transmission or sleep. In practice, however, this selection will be limited as the standard reserves some resources for signaling, channel sounding, or pilot transmission. Since the scheduler will be less potent due to this limited selection, power consumption is expected to be higher under these constraints.

Next, the power model in Chapter~\ref{ch:device} as well as all later chapters assume that a \ac{BS} can be switched on and off in an instant. Yet, although switching times are assumed to be in the order of tens of microseconds~\cite{fmmjg1101}, they are not fully instantaneous. This has to be considered in \ac{DTX} and wake--up scheduling. If sleep modes are deeper, switching times will become longer. Following this line of argument, there may actually be more than one sleep mode available; for example, an OFF state with zero power consumption, a deep sleep with very low consumption, and a light sleep for \ac{DTX}. In that case, a scheduler would have to consider the wake--up times in its selection of sleep modes.

Finally, the validity of the results presented over the coming years is strongly dependent on the assumptions made in the power model. Drastic changes in the architecture of \ac{BS}, for example through the proliferation of massive \ac{MIMO}~\cite{ltem1301}, may change the way \acp{BS} consume power. In such a case, the effectiveness of different saving techniques will have to be re-evaluated. 

For future research, the most immediate goal is to combine the \ac{RAPS} scheduler with distributed \ac{DTX} with memory and assess the joint power savings. As the \ac{RAPS} scheduler makes no assumptions about the time slots allocated for \ac{DTX}, it can provide instructions for the \ac{DTX} alignment scheme. A further planned extension to the \ac{DTX} alignment scheme is an decrease of the retransmission probability. It is expected that a rate margin imposed on the rate constraint, \ie~requesting a higher rate target, will be beneficial.

Another important addition is the consideration of standards limitations. The strength of the impact of standards limitations has to be assessed. If the standard in its current form severely caps power savings, future standards could be designed to be more open to power saving.

The power-saving \ac{RRM} mechanisms established herein can also be applied to \acp{BS} which are smaller than macro. In smaller \ac{BS} types, the load dependence is smaller. Thus, \ac{PC} is less effective compared to \ac{DTX}. Consideration of smaller \ac{BS} types is also related to the field of HetNets~\cite{hqkg1101}. Since coverage is generally assumed to overlap in HetNets, new options for longer sleep modes arise as \acp{UE} will have guaranteed coverage even when some \acp{BS} are asleep.

All analyses in this work assumed a uniform distribution of \acp{BS}. However, with the advance of HetNets, it may also be relevant to explore distributions such as Poisson Point Processes~\cite{habdf0901}. This will have an effect particularly on the multi-cell \ac{DTX} alignment work.
