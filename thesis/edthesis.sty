% ------------------
% Notes
% ~~~~~
% Sizes of margins in the 'Regulatory Standards' were taken as minimum widths,
% wider margins are used with typefaces smaller than 11pt when not using 
% twocolumns. This was done to keep the number of words per line below
% approx. 12 so as to improve readability. I do NOT know whether wide margins
% are acceptable! Check before using a 10 pt typeface.
% By default spacing is set to 1.5, not double! It looks better... but check.

Documentation:
    The 'prefacepart' environment.
    Sections are formated differently within this environment but they
    should be written using the normal LaTeX sectioning commands.

    The following commands can control what goes in the front matter:
    
	\title{thesis title}    (not changed from LaTeX)
	\author{author's name}  (not changed from LaTeX)
	\degree{name of degree} (new command)
	\maketitle              (modified from LaTeX)
	\makedeclaration        (new command)
                  
 note: The use of the 'prefacepart' environment is optional, you can do things 
       manually if you prefer (and you can still use \degree, \maketitle, and
       \makedeclaration	).
       
This style uses interline spacing that is 1.3 times normal, except
in the figure and table environments, and in footnotes where normal
spacing is used.
That can be changed by doing:
    \setstretch{1.6}
(or whatever you want instead of 1.6).

The example above shows the 12pt substyle being used.  This seems to give
acceptable looking results, but it may be omitted to get smaller print.

It is advisable to use the \include and \includeonly mechanism and to keep
the chapters in separate files (see the LaTeX Manual).

The use of roman page numbers in the preface part is not mandatory,
only continuous pagination is required by the Regulatory Standards.

%% AUTHOR: Erica M. S. Harris
%% DATE:   April 1990
%% MOD:    March 1991
%% DESCR:  LaTeX Document style option "setspace"
%%         Usage:  \documentstyle[...,setspace,...]{...}
%%         Based on the doublespace option created by Stephen Page.
%%
%%         This style option provides commands and environments for doing
%%         double and  one-and-a-half spacing based on pt size.
%%
%%         Single spacing is the default.
%%
%%         Three commands, \doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, and
%%         \singlespacing, are for use in the preamble to set the overall
%%         spacing for the document.  If a different spacing is required then
%%         the \setstretch{baselinestretch} command can be used in the
%%         preamble to set the baselinestretch appropriately.  The default
%%         spacing with this style option is single spacing.
%%
%%         Three environments, singlespace, onehalfspace, and doublespace,
%%         allow the spacing to be changed within the document.  Both the
%%         onehalfspace and doublespace environments are intended to increase
%%         the spacing, so the onehalfspace environment should not be used in
%%         a double spaced document.  If an increased spacing different from
%%         one-and-a-half or double spacing is required then the spacing
%%         environment can be used.  The spacing environment takes one
%%         argument which is the larger baselinestretch to use,
%%         e.g., \begin{spacing}{2.5}.

% Release date: 6 July 1986 - September 3, 1986
%
% Known bugs:
%    . It might be nice if spacing before the footnote rule (\footins)
%      were provided in a tidier way.
%    . Increasing struts may possibly cause some other obscure part of
%      formatting to fall over.
%    . \begin{singlespace}\begin{quote} produces the wrong spacing before
%      the quote (extra glue is inserted).
%    . shouldn't @setsize stretch parskip as well?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% MODS (March 1991):
%%         Redefinition of \spacing and \endspacing for consistency with
%%         TeX 3.x inserted by George Greenwade.  Modification provided by
%%         Philip Ross (ROSS@UK.AC.ABDN.BIOMED) and John Byrne via INFO-TeX.
%%
%%         Redefinition of \enddoublespace as suggested by Kim A. Tan
%%         <KATAN@CGRVAX.UWaterloo.CA> (also via INFO-TeX) (prevously, the
%%         "end" was missing, causing some problems in spacing changes).

% PREFACE part
% ~~~~~~~
% An environment that changes formating of the chapters that appear within it.
% Modified from suthesis.sty (Stanford Univ.)
%
% we change the formating but try as far as possible not to add new
% commands. Why? So that it is possible to print the text if edthesis.sty is
% not available simply by commenting out the 'prefacepart' environment, or 
% defining a dummy 'prefacepart'.
%
% We use an 'environment' rather than two commands as in suthesis.sty
%   for three reasons:
% 1. It allows LaTeX to check matching of \begin and \end.
% 2. It creates a scope that encloses the 'prefacepart', and so it is easier
%    to keep the changes local.
% 3. It is consistent with the philosophy of LaTeX, that the text should be 
%    independent of the format used for printing.
