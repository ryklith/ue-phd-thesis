	to sense the same channel conditions (radio frequency (RF) signature)
	previously observed at the leading antenna. Computer simulations
	show that, with estimation errors of less than 1.2% around average
	pedestrian speeds, the approach is indeed effective and accurate.
	A by-product of the algorithm is an environment specific spatial
	correlation function which is used in the second algorithm to provide
	even better estimates. With the improvements offered by the latter
	algorithm, the relative error is 0.7% or lower for 99% of estimates
	under the best-case scenario. This improvement in performance over
	the first algorithm comes at the cost of slightly higher computational
	complexity.},

	that will provide a minimum C/I, and power control and intracell
	handoffs are used to maintain this level. We focus on the relationship
	between system performance and the amount of imbalance in load among
	neighboring cells. Previous studies for systems that do not use C/I
	information have found that dynamic channel allocation (DCA) outperforms
	fixed channel allocation (FCA) in all but heavily loaded systems
	with little load imbalance. We present two principal new results.
	First, we find that with use of C/I information, the difference in
	performance between FCA and DCA (in terms of throughput or blocking
	probability) is increasing with load imbalance. DCA was found to
	be more effective in congestion control at the cost of a slightly
	lower call quality. Second, we find that use of power control to
	maintain a minimum C/I results in two equilibrium average power levels
	for both DCA and FCA, with DCA using a higher average power than
	FCA, and that while DCA's power is increasing with load imbalance,
	FCA's average power is decreasing with load imbalance},

	to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for the transmission of signals
	over fading channels. The Euclidean distance (ED) metric, associated
	with the decoded information sequence or a suitable modification
	thereof, is used as a channel quality measure. Simulations show that
	the filtered or averaged metric is a reliable channel quality measure
	which remains consistent across different coded modulation schemes

	handoff (MAHO) and power control. We particularly focus on data rate
	adaptation and propose a set of coded modulation schemes which utilize
	the SINR estimate to adapt between modulations, thus improving the
	data throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed metric
	works well across the entire range of Dopplers to provide near-optimal
	rate adaptation to average SINR. This method of adaptation averages
	out short-term variations due to Rayleigh fading and adapts to the
	long-term effects such as shadowing. At low Dopplers, the metric
	can track Rayleigh fading and match the rate to a short-term average

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with various aspects of the characterization
	of randomly time-variant linear channels. At the outset it is demonstrated
	that time-varying linear channels (or filters) may be characterized
	in an interesting symmetrical manner in time and frequency variables
	by arranging system functions in (timefrequency) dual pairs. Following
	this a statistical characterization of randomly time-variant linear
	channels is carried out in terms of correlation functions for the
	various system functions. These results are specialized by considering
	three classes of practically interesting channels. These are the
	wide-sense stationary (WSS) channel, the uncorrelated scattering
	(US) channel, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering
	(WSSUS) channel. The WSS and US channels are shown to be (time-frequency)
	duals. Previous discussions of channel correlation functions and
	their relationships have dealt exclusively with the WSSUS channel.
	The point of view presented here of dealing with the dually related
	system functions and starting with the unrestricted linear channels
	is considerably more general and places in proper perspective previous
	results on the WSSUS channel. Some attention is given to the problem
	of characterizing radio channels. A model called the Quasi-WSSUS
	channel is presented to model the behavior of such channels. All
	real-life channels and signals have an essentially finite number
	of degrees of freedom due to restrictions on time duration and bandwidth.
	This fact may be used to derive useful canonical channel models with
	the aid of sampling theorems and power series expansions. Several
	new canonical channel models are derived in this paper, some of which
	are dual to those of Kailath.},

	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type

	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
	is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness

  abstract = {We analyze in this paper the fairness of the 802.11 DCF (distributed
	coordination function) access method. Short-term fairness is an important
	property of a MAC layer for obtaining short delays. We show that
	contrary to the common wisdom, a 802.11 cell with two hosts does
	not exhibit short-term unfairness. We propose a new fairness index:
	the number of inter-transmissions that other hosts may perform between
	two transmissions of a given host. By means of this index, we analyze
	the fairness of 802.11 for the case of two hosts and derive the probability
	distribution of the number of inter-transmissions. Our results show
	that even on the short term time scale the 802.11 DCF access method
	provides fairness to competing hosts. When compared with slotted
	ALOHA, a multiple access randomized protocol with good fairness properties,
	802.11 presents even better fairness. To validate the model, we compare
	the analytical results with experimental histograms obtained via
	simulations and measurements.},

	gain and transmission powers. In this paper, distributed control
	of rate and font color=990000>power/b> for best effort data services
	is considered. In particular, we elaborate on the problem of how
	to control the transmission rates for maximizing system throughput
	while simultaneously minimizing the transmission powers. We assume
	a practical scenario, where every user has a finite set of discrete
	transmission rates and propose a simple heuristic rate allocation
	scheme, greedy rate packing (GRP), applicable in both up- and downlink.
	The scheme can be interpreted as a practical form of water-filling,
	in the sense that high transmission rates are allocated to users
	having high link gains and low interference. We show that under certain
	conditions, GRP will give maximum throughput and that it can be extended
	to guarantee a minimum data rate while maximizing network excess
	capacity. We suggest and analyze a distributed font color=990000>power/b>
	control algorithm to control the intercell interference when GRP
	is applied to a multicellular system. Numerical results show that
	the proposed transmission scheme can significantly decrease the font

	The accuracy of this estimate is quantified both as a radius uncertainty
	(e.g., ???100 m) and as a coverage (i.e., area/edge) reliability
	error through: (1) simulation; (2) analysis of real data; and (3)
	theoretical analysis. It is shown that if the estimate of the cell
	radius meets the desired accuracy, then the corresponding estimates
	of coverage reliability (both area and edge) are more than sufficiently
	accurate. Through a sensitivity analysis, it is discovered that estimating
	the cell radius is a much more critical step in determining the quality
	of RF coverage than the more common practice of simply estimating
	the area reliability. In addition, a formula for estimating area
	reliability is given and shown to be more accurate than can be obtained
	by current approaches. The verification method presented is particularly
	useful in wireless planning since it effectively determines the geographic

  abstract = {Fraud is increasing dramatically with the expansion of modern technology
	and the global superhighways of communication, resulting in the loss
	of billions of dollars worldwide each year. Although prevention technologies
	are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters are adaptive and, given
	time, will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Methodologies
	for the detection of fraud are essential if we are to catch fraudsters
	once fraud prevention has failed. Statistics and machine learning
	provide effective technologies for fraud detection and have been
	applied successfully to detect activities such as money laundering,
	e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud and computer
	intrusion, to name but a few. We describe the tools available for
	statistical fraud detection and the areas in which fraud detection
	technologies are most used.},

  abstract = {The relative delay tolerance of data applications, together with bursty
	traffic characteristics, opens up the possibility for scheduling
	transmissions so as to optimize throughput. A particularly attractive
	approach in fading environments is to exploit the variations in the
	channel conditions and transmit to the user with the current "best"
	channel. We show that the "best" user may be identified as the maximum-rate
	user when feasible rates are weighted with some appropriately determined
	coefficients. Interpreting the coefficients as shadow prices, or
	reward values, the optimal strategy may thus be viewed as a revenue-based
	policy, which always assigns the transmission slot to the user yielding
	the maximum revenue. Calculating the optimal-revenue vector directly
	is a formidable task, requiring detailed information on the channel
	statistics. Instead, we present adaptive algorithms for determining
	the optimal-revenue vector online in an iterative fashion, without
	the need for explicit knowledge of the channel behavior. Starting
	from an arbitrary initial vector, the algorithms iteratively adjust
	the reward values to compensate for observed deviations from the
	target throughput rates. The algorithms are validated through extensive
	numerical experiments. Besides verifying long-run convergence, we
	also examine the transient performance, in particular the rate of
	convergence to the optimal-revenue vector. The results show that
	the target throughput ratios are tightly maintained and that the
	algorithms are well able to track sudden changes in channel conditions
	or throughput targets.},

  number = {8},
  abstract = {Currently, a global third-generation cellular system based on code-division
	multiple-access (CDMA) is being developed with a wider bandwidth
	than existing second-generation systems. The wider bandwidth provides
	increased multipath resolution in a time-dispersive channel, leading
	to higher frequency-selectivity. A generalized RAKE receiver for
	interference suppression and multipath mitigation is proposed. The
	receiver exploits the fact that time dispersion significantly distorts
	the interference spectrum from each base station in the downlink
	of a wideband CDMA system. Compared to the conventional RAKE receiver,
	this generalized RAKE receiver may have more fingers and different
	combining weights. The weights are derived from a maximum likelihood
	formulation, modeling the intracell interference as colored Gaussian
	noise. This low-complexity detector is especially useful for systems
	with orthogonal downlink spreading codes, as orthogonality between
	own cell signals cannot be maintained in a frequency-selective channel.
	The performance of the proposed receiver is quantified via analysis
	and simulation for different dispersive channels, including Rayleigh
	fading channels. Gains on the order of 1-3.5 dB are achieved, depending
	on the dispersiveness of the channel, with only a modest increase
	in the number of fingers. For a wideband CDMA (WCDMA) system and
	a realistic mobile radio channel, this translates to capacity gains
	of the order of 100%},

  abstract = {There are new system implementation challenges involved in the design
	of cognitive radios, which have both the ability to sense the spectral
	environment and the flexibility to adapt transmission parameters
	to maximize system capacity while coexisting with legacy wireless
	networks. The critical design problem is the need to process multigigahertz
	wide bandwidth and reliably detect presence of primary users. This
	places severe requirements on sensitivity, linearity and dynamic
	range of the circuitry in the RF front-end. To improve radio sensitivity
	of the sensing function through processing gain we investigated three
	digital signal processing techniques: matched filtering, energy detection
	and cyclostationary feature detection. Our analysis shows that cyclostationary
	feature detection has advantages due to its ability to differentiate
	modulated signals, interference and noise in low signal to noise
	ratios. In addition, to further improve the sensing reliability,
	the advantage of a MAC protocol that exploits cooperation among many
	cognitive users is investigated.},

  abstract = {We consider a wireless communication system formed by a single cell
	with one base station and K user terminals. User channels are characterized
	by frequency-selective fading due to small-scale effects, modeled
	as a set of M parallel block-fading channels, and a frequency-flat
	distance-dependent path loss. We compare delay-limited systems with
	variable-rate systems under fairness constraints, in terms of the
	achieved system spectral efficiency C (bit/s/Hz) versus Eb /N0. The
	considered delay- limited systems impose "hard-fairness": every user
	transmits at its desired rate on all blocks, independently of its
	fading conditions. The variable-rate system imposes "proportional
	fairness" via the popular Proportional Fair Scheduling (PFS) algorithm,
	currently implemented in 3G wireless for data ( delay-tolerant) applications.
	We find simple iterative resource allocation algorithms that converge
	to the optimal delay- limited throughput for orthogonal (frequency-division
	multiple access (FDMA)/time-division multiple access (TDMA)) and
	optimal (superposition/interference cancellation) signaling. In the
	limit of large K and finite M we find closed-form expressions for
	C as a function of Eb/N0. We show that in this limit, the optimal
	allocation policy consists of letting each user transmit on its best
	subchannel only. Also, we find a simple closed-form expression for
	the throughput of PFS in a cellular environment, that holds for any
	K and M. Finally, we obtain closed-form expressions for C versus
	Eb/N 0 in the low and high spectral efficiency regimes. The conclusions
	of our analysis in terms of system design guidelines are as follows:
	a) if hard fairness is a requirement, orthogonal access incurs a
	large throughput penalty with respect to the optimal (superposition
	coding) strategy, especially in the regime of high spectral efficiency;
	b) for high spectral efficiency, PFS does not provide any significant
	gain and ma- y even perform worse than the optimal delay-limited
	system, despite the fact that the imposed fairness constraint is
	laxer; c) for low to moderate spectral efficiency, the stricter hard-fairness
	constraint incurs in a large throughput penalty with respect to PFS},

	Both solutions attribute voice users one single resource pair, i.e.,
	one time slot and a single code to employ on that time slot, but
	differ in the way data users requests are accommodated: they are
	either simultaneously granted several codes over the same time slot
	or are assigned a single code over several distinct time slots. Call
	admission control is performed by a channel assignment algorithm
	which dynamically attributes resources only if specified levels of
	transmission quality are met on the radio channels. The blocking
	and the outage probability of the two classes of users are determined

	system at different values of cell radius are studied. For a given
	cluster size, sectorization provides a higher signal-to- interference
	(S/I) ratio but reduces the spectrum efficiency of the system. It
	is demonstrated that it is possible to achieve higher spectrum efficiency
	by reducing the cluster size in a sectorized system without lowering
	the S/I ratio below the minimum requirement. In this respect, under
	both shadowing and nonshadowing conditions, there is an increase

	within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly
	detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain

	to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research

	categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique.
	For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used
	by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.
	When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions
	can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique
	in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection
	technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in
	that category are variants of the basic technique. This template
	provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques
	belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify
	the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category.
	We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the

	universal frequency reuse and DS-CDMA transmission however, the ensuing
	cross-tier interference causes unacceptable outage probability. This
	paper develops an uplink capacity analysis and interference avoidance
	strategy in such a two-tier CDMA network. We evaluate a network-wide
	area spectral efficiency metric called the operating contour (OC)
	defined as the feasible combinations of the average number of active
	macrocell users and femtocell base stations (BS) per cell-site that
	satisfy a target outage constraint. The capacity analysis provides
	an accurate characterization of the uplink outage probability, accounting
	for power control, path loss and shadowing effects. Considering worst
	case interference at a corner femtocell, results reveal that interference
	avoidance through a time-hopped CDMA physical layer and sectorized
	antennas allows about a 7x higher femtocell density, relative to
	a split spectrum two-tier network with omnidirectional femtocell
	antennas. A femtocell exclusion region and a tier selection based

	the specific version of FFR and then color the graph using the corresponding
	graph algorithm. The performance improvement enabled by the proposed
	dynamic FFR scheme is further demonstrated by compu ter simulation
	for a 19-cell network with asymmetric cell load. For instance, the

	is very sensitive to other-cell interference, which will in practice
	
	necessitate network level interference reduction strategies.
	
	As an alternative to traditional static frequency reuse patterns,
	
	this paper investigates intercell scheduling among neighboring
	
	base stations. We show analytically that cooperatively scheduled
	
	transmission, which is well within the capability of present
	
	systems, can achieve an expanded multiuser diversity gain in
	
	terms of ergodic capacity as well as almost the same amount of

	gain over conventional frequency reuse is O(Mt logNs)

	division, where Ns is the number of cooperating base stations
	
	employing opportunistic scheduling in an Mt  Mr MIMO
	
	system.
	
	From a theoretical standpoint, an interesting aspect of this
	
	analysis comes from an altered view of multiuser diversity in
	
	the context of a multi-cell system. Previously, multiuser diversity
	
	capacity gain has been known to grow as O(log logK), from
	
	selecting the maximum of K exponentially-distributed powers.
	
	Because multicell considerations such as the positions of the
	
	users, lognormal shadowing, and pathloss affect the multiuser
	
	diversity gain, we find instead that the gain is O( 2 logK), from
	
	selecting the maximum of a compound lognormal-exponential
	
	distribution. Finding the maximum of such a distribution is an
	
	additional contribution of the paper.},

  abstract = {The OFDMA systems are emerging for future cellular networks. Creating
	multiple data channels, they can support the flexible frequency reuse
	factor (FRF). Although FRF 1 is the best choice in terms of cell
	throughput, it causes intercell interference at the cell boundary,
	thereby being unable to serve the whole cell area. Therefore it was
	proposed to use the FRF of greater than 3. In this paper, we develop
	a flexible FRF design mechanism that provides an intermediate value
	between 1 and 3 while the conventional schemes are dedicated to use
	some integer numbers only such as 3, 4, or 7. In our design, if the
	number of shared channels between any neighboring cells is given,
	we implement it simply according to a difference set. Simulation
	results show that a FRF of 7/4 achieves better throughput than FRF

	D-TDD system. In the TRTP, the influence of the CCI in the CTS region
	is further reduced by assigning the minislots closer to the switching
	point to the users having higher link gains. By the computer simulation,

	The technique uses a very large set of frequency-hopped signals which
	are designed for minimal mutual interference. No synchronization
	of the mobile units is required, and each user is permanently assigned
	his own signal, which serves as an identifying signal and as a carrier
	for the biphase-modulated digital message. The spectral efficiency
	of the spread-spectrum system is analyzed and compared with the efficiencies
	of developmental FM/channel reuse schemes currently under construction
	in the U.S. and Japan. It is concluded that even with relatively
	simple speech digitization schemes, the efficiency of the spread-spectrum
	scheme may exceed those of the narrow-band schemes by a factor of
	almost five. More ambitious bit-rate-reducing speech digitization
	methods could improve still further on these figures. Additional

	second-generation systems, full support of adaptive antenna arrays,
	support of hierarchical cell structures with interfrequency handover,
	and support of asynchronous inter- base-station operation. There

	a practical algorithm that is capable of finding the joint optimal
	beamformers for all base-stations globally and efficiently. The proposed
	algorithm is based on a generalization of uplink-downlink duality
	to the multi-cell setting using the Lagrangian duality theory. The

	cells to the hot ones through a distributed channel borrowing algorithm.
	With the help of a Markov model, the probability of a cell being
	hot and the call blocking probability in a cell are derived. Detailed
	simulation experiments are carried out in order to evaluate our proposed

  abstract = {In this paper, a power consumption model for both macrocell and microcell
	base stations is proposed. This model is validated by temporal power
	measurements on actual base stations, and an excellent agreement
	is obtained. Furthermore, the power consumption's evolution during
	the day is investigated by means of these measurements. The energy
	efficiency of three different wireless technologies is compared namely
	mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, Long Term
	Evolution and High Speed Packet Access. With the model proposed,
	the deployment tool Green Radio Access Network Design is implemented,
	which allows to design an energy-efficient access network for a predefined
	area. In general and with the assumptions made, a macrocell base
	station consumes about 4.4 times more than a microcell base station.
	However, a microcell base station is less energy efficient than a
	macrocell base station because of its lower coverage range. Despite
	this, it is still useful to introduce them in the network as the
	same coverage can be obtained with a lower total power consumption
	than with a network where only macrocell base stations are used.Copyright

	algorithms are sought for. To this end, we propose decentralized
	resource allocation algorithms that enable base stations to select
	a pool of favorable resources with low interference based on local
	knowledge only. The actual user-level resource allocation from that

	existence of Nash equilibria shows that stable resource allocations
	can be reached by selfish agents. In addition to that, we perform
	simulations to determine the speed of convergence and the resulting
	equilibrium interference levels. By comparing these to an optimal
	global solution, which is derived by solving an integer linear program,
	we are able to quantify the efficiency loss of the distributed game

  abstract = {Spatial antenna diversity has been important in improving the radio
	link between wireless users. Historically, microscopic antenna diversity
	has been used to reduce the fading seen by a radio receiver, whereas
	macroscopic diversity provides multiple listening posts to ensure
	that mobile communication links remain intact over a wide geographic
	area. In later years, the concepts of spatial diversity have been
	expanded to build foundations for emerging technologies, such as
	smart (adaptive) antennas and position location systems. Smart antennas
	hold great promise for increasing the capacity of wireless communications
	because they radiate and receive energy only in the intended directions,
	thereby greatly reducing interference. To properly design, analyze,
	and implement smart antennas and to exploit spatial processing in
	emerging wireless systems, accurate radio channel models that incorporate
	spatial characteristics are necessary. In this tutorial, we review
	the key concepts in spatial channel modeling and present emerging
	approaches. We also review the research issues in developing and
	using spatial channel models for adaptive antennas},

  abstract = {A quasi-synchronous (QS) code division multiple access (CDMA) system
	is proposed for mobile communications. In the proposed method, which
	uses the time division duplex (TDD) mode of transmission, a mobile
	receiver can measure changes of the propagation delay. It then accordingly
	adjusts its transmission time so its signal can arrive at base station
	synchronously with other mobile units. A simple control unit is used
	at the mobile unit in order to reduce any error due to changes in
	propagation delay. The system operates as follows. At the start of
	a call, a mobile unit is quasi-synchronised through feedback control
	from the base station. The mobile unit then maintains synchronous
	status without any further base station feedback. The degree of the
	quasi-synchronous accuracy is determined by a clock in mobile units.
	This paper shows performance results based on using a clock rate
	of ten times faster than the spreading rate. Orthogonal codes are
	used for spreading the signals. These results demonstrate that the
	reverse link CDMA multiuser interference is to a great degree removed},

	selected and used for transmission, creating in effect a pre-selection

	access to a cellular network through a Home Base Station, which is
	connected via internet to the operator's core network, helping to
	improve coverage in indoors, offload the macrocell and reduce costs
	for operators. However, large scale deployment of femtocells can
	severely interfere with the existing macrocell within which they
	are deployed, particularly when operating in co-channel or in immediate
	adjacent channels with respect to the macrocell and when using a
	closed access policy. For instance, macrocell coverage holes in the
	downlink will appear, i.e. zones in the vicinity of a home base station
	where interference from home base station signals will prevent macrocell
	users to receive the desired service from the macrocell network.
	In this paper, we estimate macrocell coverage holes produced by closed
	access femtocells when both, macro and femto networks operate FDD
	WCDMA-based technologies. We investigate the case when the home base
	station transmits at constant power and when uses a power adjustment

	can have a radius up to 30 meters when the same carrier is used and
	up to 5 m when carriers separated 5 MHz are used. Finally, we analyze

	multiple access - time division duplex (OFDMA-TDD) cellular networks
	when jointly applying dynamic channel allocation (DCA) and user scheduling
	under the assumption of asymmetric uplink (UL)/downlink (DL) loads.
	Specifically, a comparison between a fixed slot allocation (FSA)
	scheme, where the uplink UL/DL switching is synchronised across the
	network, and the random time slot opposing (RTSO) technique is made.
	The RTSO resembles an opportunistic interference mitigation technique.
	RTSO, however, does not obviate the need for user scheduling algorithms,
	but the combined use of RTSO and scheduling has not been studied.
	Therefore, two different scheduling algorithms, greedy and fair,
	are adapted to suit the OFDMA-TDD architecture. Their performance
	for various channel asymmetries under RTSO and symmetric FSA is evaluated,
	based on spectral efficiency and user outage. In order to account
	for the exposed location of base station (BS) antennas in a cellular
	environment, the effect of line-of-sight (LOS) propagation among
	BSs is considered. The results show that LOS among BSs in a system
	with unsynchronised switching points strongly hampers the network's
	performance. This effect, however, is demonstrated to be substantially
	offset by DL-favoured asymmetries (dominant in data-centric networks)
	in combination with RTSO. Furthermore, it is shown that the greedy
	algorithm only offers a marginal increase in spectral efficiency
	as compared to the fair algorithm, while the fair algorithm exhibits
	up to ~20% lower outage.},

	provide MT location estimates in almost every scenario, but they

	Thus, a promising approach is to combine measured values from the

	In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based hybrid localization
	method is proposed that combines round trip time and received signal
	strength measured values available from the Global System for Mobile
	Communication (GSM) and pseudorange (PR) measured values from GPS,
	in order to track the MT's movement. In contrast to existing hybrid
	approaches, an EKF-based MT tracking algorithm is proposed that additionally
	takes into account sectorized BS antennas which are typically employed
	in existing GSM networks, and it takes into account PR instead of
	geometric range (or time of arrival) measured values from GPS as
	GSM is normally not time-synchronized to GPS. Simulation and experimental

	distributions on the performance of a CDMA cellular system. While,
	there have been many studies showing the capacity gains of CDMA over
	narrowband TDMA systems, most of these studies assume a uniform distribution
	of the user population across the coverage area. When compared to
	the more general case of non- uniform user distributions, the uniform
	user distribution leads to lower multi-user interference and consequently
	higher system capacity. Hence, use of these models can lead to overestimation
	of system capacity. Three non-uniform user density models are developed
	and used to analyze the system's performance in typical CDMA implementation
	scenarios. The results indicate that intra-cell multi-user interference
	dominates the total interference levels in most cases. As expected
	cell splitting is shown to improve the system performance. The most
	significant improvements in performance with cell-splitting are seen
	for a Gaussian user density model (when compared to linear or exponential
	user density models). The results provide additional insight into
	the performance of CDMA systems, and are useful for the purposes
	of network planning and resource allocation},

	overall network capacity as a measure of system performance. We consider
	the problem of resource allocation and adaptive transmission in multicell
	scenarios. As a key instance, the problem of joint scheduling and
	power control simultaneously in multiple transmit-receive links,
	which employ capacity-achieving adaptive codes, is studied. In principle,
	the solution of such an optimization hinges on tough issues such
	as the computational complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter
	feedback and, for cellular networks, cell-to-cell channel state information
	(CSI) signaling. We give asymptotic properties pertaining to rate-maximizing
	power control and scheduling in multicell networks. We then present
	some promising leads for substantial complexity and signaling reduction
	via the use of newly developed distributed and game theoretic techniques.},

	to resolve the spectrum scarcity by allowing unlicensed users to

	In particular, distribution of the aggregate interference is characterized

	Employing dynamic spectral reuse, we allow for centralized control.
	In the two-link case, the optimal power allocation then has a remarkably
	simple nature termed binary power control: depending on the noise
	and channel gains, assign full power to one link and minimum to the
	other, or full power on both. Binary power control (BPC) has the
	advantage of leading towards simpler or even distributed power control
	algorithms. For N>2 we propose a strategy based on checking the corners
	of the domain resulting from the power constraints to perform BPC.
	We identify scenarios in which binary power allocation can be proven
	optimal also for arbitrary N. Furthermore, in the general setting
	for N>2, simulations demonstrate that a throughput performance with
	negligible loss, compared to the best non-binary scheme found by
	geometric programming, can be obtained by BPC. Finally, to reduce

	downlink data transmissions to different terminals. By dynamically
	assigning different sets of subcarriers to different terminals they
	also have the potential to react to fast changing attenuation states
	of wireless channels. It has been shown that hence dynamic OFDM-FDMA
	systems can improve various transmission metrics such as throughput
	or required power. However, these dynamic systems require a signaling
	mechanism informing each terminal prior to the data transmission
	itself which subcarriers they have been assigned. We study the dependency
	between overhead caused by the signaling system and number of subcarriers
	used in the system for a varying number of terminals in the cell.
	We find that in terms of resulting throughput per terminal there
	exists an optimal number of subcarriers into which the bandwidth
	should be split. This optimal number depends on the setting (especially,
	terminal number) and provides, if used, a significant performance
	increase compared to using a fixed number of subcarriers.},

	specific cyclic delays are chosen properly. Without any additional
	effort this increased frequency selectivity can be exploited by using
	a forward error correction (FEC) code, e.g., a convolutional code
	that benefits from an altered error distribution after demodulation.
	In this paper we investigate a simple multiple antenna transmission
	scheme that exploits the frequency selectivity of the channel even
	without FEC coding. On each antenna a shifted version of the signal
	is sent which enables the receiver to apply optimum demodulation.
	We analyze the choice of the cyclic delay and present a comparison

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that code division multiple access (CDMA)
	provides great flexibility by enabling efficient multiuser access
	in a cellular environment. In addition, time division duplex (TDD)
	as compared to frequency division duplex (FDD) represents an appropriate
	method to cater for the asymmetric use of a duplex channel. However,
	the TDD technique is subject to additional interference mechanisms
	compared to an FDD system, in particular if neighboring cells require
	different rates of asymmetry. If TDD is combined with an interference
	limited multiple access technique such as CDMA, the additional interference
	mechanism represents an important issue. This issue poses the question
	of whether a CDMA/TDD air-interface can be used in a cellular environment.
	The problems are eased if a hybrid time division multiple access
	(TDMA)/CDMA interface (TD-CDMA) is used. The reason for this is that
	the TDMA component adds another degree of freedom which can be utilized
	to avoid interference. This, however, requires special channel assignment
	techniques. A notable example of a system which uses a TD-CDMA/TDD
	interface is the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).
	This paper presents a novel centralized dynamic channel assignment
	(DCA) algorithm for a TD-CDMA/TDD air-interface. The DCA algorithm
	exploits a new technique which is termed ???TS-opposing technique.???

	and frame synchronisation are varied. It is shown that the most detrimental
	effects for the FDD interface are for small BS separations. In contrast,
	the optimum with respect to TDD capacity is found for the co- location
	of both base stations. This yields a trade-off for the optimal BS
	locations. Moreover, an adjacent channel protection factor of 30
	dB in an interference limited system such as CDMA is shown to be

  abstract = {In ad hoc networks, the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems
	can severely reduce the network capacity on the MAC layer. To address
	these problems, the ready-to-send and clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) dialogue
	has been proposed in the literature. However, MAC schemes using only
	the RTS/CTS dialogue cannot completely solve the hidden and the exposed
	terminal problems, as pure "packet sensing" MAC schemes are not safe
	even in fully connected networks. We propose a new MAC protocol,
	termed the dual busy tone multiple access (DBTMA) scheme. The operation
	of the DBTMA protocol is based on the RTS packet and two narrow-
	bandwidth, out-of-band busy tones. With the use of the RTS packet
	and the receive busy tone, which is set up by the receiver, our scheme
	completely solves the hidden- and the exposed-terminal problems.
	The busy tone, which is set up by the transmitter, provides protection
	for the RTS packets, increasing the probability of successful RTS
	reception and, consequently, increasing the throughput. This paper
	outlines the operation rules of the DBTMA scheme and analyzes its
	performance. Simulation results are also provided to support the
	analytical results. It is concluded that the DBTMA protocol is superior
	to other schemes that rely on the RTS/CTS dialogue on a single channel
	or to those that rely on a single busy tone. As a point of reference,
	the DBTMA scheme out-performs FAMA-NCS by 20-40\% in our simulations
	using the network topologies borrowed from the FAMA-NCS paper. In
	an ad hoc network with a large coverage area, DBTMA achieves performance
	gain of 140\% over FAMA-NCS and performance gain of 20\% over RI-
	BTMA},

	The pure non-cooperative game may result in non-convergence

	individual performances. To enhance the performances, a virtual
	
	referee is introduced to the networks and is in charge of monitoring

	some radio resources such as sub-channels, so that the rest of
	
	users can share the limited resources more efficiently. Moreover,

	such as an overall reduction in transmit power and the possibility
	of increased capacity. In addition, the self-organising nature of
	the network may reduce the need for network planning and basestation
	infrastructure. Disadvantages include an overall increase in complexity,
	and the problem of a particular user's terminal being used for the
	benefit of others. Results are presented that quantify the gains
	in capacity that can be brought about by the lower levels of interference
	due to reduced transmit power throughout a sample test network. A
	simulation platform is described which uses IR as an enhancement
	to a hybrid TDD/CDMA air interface similar to the UTRA TDD mode.
	It is shown that capacity can be increased although this capacity
	gain is dependent an there being a sufficient number of users available

	nodes around the desired receiver in order to increase the likelihood
	of successful communication. This paper introduces the concept of
	a guard zone, defined as the region around each receiver where interfering
	transmissions are inhibited. Using stochastic geometry, the guard
	zone size that maximizes the transmission capacity for spread spectrum
	ad hoc networks is derived - narrowband transmission (spreading gain
	of unity) is a special case. A large guard zone naturally decreases
	the interference, but at the cost of inefficient spatial reuse. The
	derived results provide insight into the design of contention resolution
	algorithms by quantifying the optimal tradeoff between interference
	and spatial reuse in terms of the system parameters. A capacity increase
	relative to random access (ALOHA) in the range of 2 - 100 fold is
	demonstrated through an optimal guard zone; the capacity increase
	depending primarily on the required outage probability, as higher
	required QoS increasingly rewards scheduling. Compared to the ubiquitous
	carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) which essentially implements
	a guard zone around the transmitter rather than the receiver - we
	observe a capacity increase on the order of 30 - 100\%},

	the matrix coefficient and given vector are comprised of real numbers,
	arises in many applications: communications, cryptography, GPS, to
	name a few. The problem is equivalent to finding the closest lattice
	point to a given point and is known to be NP-hard. In communications
	applications, however, the given vector is not arbitrary, but rather
	is an unknown lattice point that has been perturbed by an additive

	The technique, called space-time spreading (STS), improves the downlink
	performance by using a small number of antenna elements at the base
	and one or more antennas at the handset, in conjunction with a novel
	spreading scheme that is inspired by space-time codes. It spreads
	each signal in a balanced way over the transmitter antenna elements
	to provide maximal path diversity at the receiver. In doing so, no
	extra spreading codes, transmit power or channel information are
	required at the transmitter and only minimal extra hardware complexity
	at both sides of the link. Both our analysis and simulation results
	show significant performance gains over conventional single-antenna
	systems and other open-loop transmit diversity techniques. Our approach
	is a practical way to increase the bit rate and/or improve the quality
	and range in the downlink of either mobile or fixed CDMA systems.
	A STS- based proposal for the case of two transmitter and single-

	the basestation must signal which UEs are being allocated resources

	case of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless standard, this signalling
	is performed over the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH).
	The amount of resources allocated to the PDCCH can be varied. However,
	if the allocated amount is too small then the uplink and downlink
	data schedulers will not be able to schedule all UEs that need to
	be served but if the allocated amount is too large then resources

	must therefore be addressed, the determination of the number of resources
	to be allocated to the PDCCH and, given this allocation, how should
	UEs be efficiently signalled over the PDCCH. Our focus in this paper
	is on the second issue but we also briefly address how one can approach

	designed for multihop cellular networks (MCNs) for wireless data
	communications. MCN, in which packets are multi-hopped to their destination,
	is hybrid of traditional single-hop cellular networks (SCNs) and
	ad-hoc networks architecture. Because the existing routing protocols
	designed for ad-hoc networks are not suitable for MCN, herein, a
	hybrid of table-driven and demand- driven protocols with base-centric
	computing is designed. The base tracks network topology by the table-driven
	method and can thus compute paths for MSs, constituting base-centric
	computing. When paths are needed by MSs, when is demand-driven, the
	path query messages are unicast to the base. If MSs do not obtain
	paths from the base, then path query messages will be flooded as
	in AODV. Simulation yields the following conclusions. The throughput
	of MCN increases as radio distance decreases and is higher than that
	of SCN. When the radio distance in MCN is the same as that in SCN,
	the throughput in MCN is about twice that in SCN. Moreover, the improvement
	can be by up to a factor of three when the radio distance in MCN
	is 1/4 of that in SCN. The hybrid protocol outperforms AODV because
	with base-centric computing, path query messages can be unicast to
	the base and the overhead is greatly reduced. Without mobility, UDP
	outperforms TCP. However, with mobility, TCP outperforms UDP.},

	(QoS) requirements for each user are represented by a cost function,
	which is an increasing function of queue length. The objective is
	to find a scheduling rule that minimizes the average cost over time.
	We consider two scenarios: 1) the cost functions are linear, and
	packets arrive to the queues according to a Poisson process and 2)
	the cost functions are increasing, convex, and there are no new arrivals
	(draining problem). In each case, we transform the system model into
	a different model that fits into a framework for stochastic scheduling
	developed by Klimov. Applying Klimov's results, we show that the
	optimal schedulers for the transformed models in both scenarios are
	specified by fixed priority rules. Applying the inverse transformation
	in each case gives the optimal scheduling policy for the original
	problem. The priorities can be explicitly computed, and in the first
	scenario, are given by simple closed-form expressions. For the draining
	problem, we show that the optimal policy never interrupts the retransmissions
	of a packet. We also show that a simple myopic scheduling policy,
	called the U'R rule, performs very close to the optimal scheduling
	policy in specific cases. We present numerical examples, which compare
	the performance of the optimal scheduling rule with several heuristic

	dynamically adjusts the bandwidth among the different services within
	the cell with changing network traffics. The proposed method, called
	min-max fairness scheme, exhibits good performances in cellular network
	applications where bandwidth is at a premium such as in multimedia
	communications. The improved efficiency of the scheme is achieved
	by considering the online and the offline services in different ways
	as well as using a strategy of temporary borrowing the reserved bandwidth
	for offline services. The scheme distributes the bandwidth among
	the services as evenly as possible and guarantees the minimum bandwidth
	to all the services besides maintaining the quality of service at
	various traffic loads. Simulation results are presented to confirm
	the superior performance compared with other recent existing schemes.},

	The CDMA system considered uses convolutional codes, orthogonal signalling,
	multipath/antenna diversity with noncoherent combining, and fast
	closed-loop power control on the uplink (portable-to-base) direction.
	On the downlink (base-to-portable), convolutional codes, BPSK modulation
	with pilot-signal-assisted coherent reception, and multipath diversity
	are employed. Both fast and slow power control are considered for
	the downlink. The capacity of the CDMA system is evaluated in a multicell
	environment taking into account shadow fading, path loss, fast fading,
	and closed-loop power control. Fast power control on the downlink
	increases the capacity significantly. Capacity is also significantly
	impacted by the path loss exponent. Narrowband CDMA (system bandwidth
	of 1.25 MHz) requires artificial multipath generation on the downlink
	to achieve adequate capacity. For smaller path loss exponents, which
	are more likely in microcellular environments, artificial multipath
	diversity of an order of as high as 4 may be needed. Wideband CDMA
	systems (10 MHz bandwidth) achieve greater efficiencies in terms

  abstract = { Sphere decoding has been suggested by a number of authors as an efficient
	algorithm to solve various detection problems in digital communications.
	In some cases, the algorithm is referred to as an algorithm of polynomial
	complexity without clearly specifying what assumptions are made about
	the problem structure. Another claim is that although worst-case
	complexity is exponential, the expected complexity of the algorithm
	is polynomial. Herein, we study the expected complexity where the
	problem size is defined to be the number of symbols jointly detected,
	and our main result is that the expected complexity is exponential
	for fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to previous claims.
	The sphere radius, which is a parameter of the algorithm, must be
	chosen to ensure a nonvanishing probability of solving the detection
	problem. This causes the exponential complexity since the squared
	radius must grow linearly with problem size. The rate of linear increase
	is, however, dependent on the noise variance, and thus, the rate
	of the exponential function is strongly dependent on the SNR. Therefore
	sphere decoding can be efficient for some SNR and problems of moderate
	size, even though the number of operations required by the algorithm

	maximizes the total data rate of multiuser orthogonal frequency division
	multiplexing (OFDM) systems in a downlink transmission. We generally
	formulate the data rate maximization problem by allowing that a subcarrier
	could be shared by multiple users. The transmit power adaptation
	scheme is derived by solving the maximization problem via two steps:
	subcarrier assignment for users and power allocation for subcarriers.
	We have found that the data rate of a multiuser OFDM system is maximized
	when each subcarrier is assigned to only one user with the best channel
	gain for that subcarrier and the transmit power is distributed over
	the subcarriers by the water-filling policy. In order to reduce the
	computational complexity in calculating water-filling level in the
	proposed transmit power adaptation method, we also propose a simple
	method where users with the best channel gain for each subcarrier
	are selected and then the transmit power is equally distributed among
	the subcarriers. Results show that the total data rate for the proposed
	transmit power adaptation methods significantly increases with the
	number of users owing to the multiuser diversity effects and is greater
	than that for the conventional frequency-division multiple access
	(FDMA)-like transmit power adaptation schemes. Furthermore, we have
	found that the total data rate of the multiuser OFDM system with
	the proposed transmit power adaptation methods becomes even higher

  abstract = {There is a widespread notion within the North American cellular industry
	that present cellular systems are intrinsically interference-limited.
	This idea in part comes from a number of reported simulations which
	were based on the assumption that mobiles always connect to the nearest
	base station. We present analytical and simulation results for the
	case where mobiles are connected to the best base station (the one
	with the strongest signal). At the 10 percent outage level, it is
	shown that the nearest server scenario tends to underestimate the
	carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio by as much as 5 dB (with respect
	to the best server case). Some system imperfections which are not
	traditionally assessed by such simulations are further discussed.
	In particular, nonideal positioning of the base stations was found
	to have negligible impact on C/I if the traditional cellular rule-of-thumb
	criteria are obeyed. Nonuniform spatial distribution of the mobiles
	was analyzed based on real data from the Toronto area. It was found
	to have negligible impact on the average C/I performance. Blocking
	problems in such a case, however, could easily reduce the theoretical
	capacity with uniform loading by as much as 30 percent. Finally,
	C/I deteriorations due to nonideal handoffs are examined. This analysis
	is very sensitive to the handoff mechanism implementation details.
	Although the results for hand-offs should be regarded with some caution,
	in view of all the results presented in this article we feel that
	cellular systems are in general limited by blocking rather than by
	interference},

	and unconstrained as well as constrained detection. The link between

  abstract = {In code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile radio systems, both
	intersymbol interference and multiple access interference arise which
	can be combated by using either elaborate optimum or favorable suboptimum
	joint detection (JD) techniques. Furthermore, the time variation
	of the radio channels leads to degradations of the receiver performance.
	These degradations can be reduced by applying diversity techniques.
	Using coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) is especially attractive
	because only the signal processing at the receiver must be modified.
	In the present paper, the application of CRAD to the more critical
	uplink of CDMA mobile radio systems with suboptimum JD techniques
	is investigated for maximal-ratio combining. The authors study six
	different suboptimum JD techniques based on decorrelating matched
	filtering, Gauss- Markov estimation, and minimum mean square error
	estimation with and without decision feedback. These six suboptimum
	JD techniques which are well-known for single antenna receivers are
	extended for the application to CRAD. A main concern of the paper
	is the determining of the SNR performance of the presented JD techniques
	for CRAD and the achievable average uncoded bit error probabilities

	a time series. While discords have many uses for data mining, they
	are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only
	require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike
	most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters.
	While the brute force algorithm to discover time series discords

	a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related
	human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S.
	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS
	was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over
	broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic
	population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily
	basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University
	of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone
	interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries
	and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions
	from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning
	and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity
	occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between
	340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of
	the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were
	completed in 63\% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents
	reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings

	are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada
	and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the
	California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity
	pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However,
	the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
	in California seems to have decreased over the same time period,
	where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker.

	instantly with anyone anywhere, is proposed. This concept offers
	a personal service network with subscriber access systems for both
	wired and radio terminals. Its three principal concepts are: (1)
	assigning a personal identity such as a personal telecommunication
	number for individual, with the network tracking the person's routing,
	(2) serving ultra-small portable units for radio link access, and
	(3) servicing advanced functions such as the network playing the
	role of secretary. An advanced personal communication system in which
	such functions as location registration and tracking exchange are
	handled by public communications networks is proposed. Cost-effective
	and rapid service development can be realizing by using such public
	communication network facilities as transport systems. The proposed
	system enables each person to afford a portable telephone set because
	of large cost reductions and increased capacity, The system architecture
	and technical problems are also presented},

	because it can form a desired antenna pattern and adaptively control
	it if an appropriate set of antenna weights is provided and updated

	An adaptive antenna array can be considered an adaptive filter in
	the space and time domains for radio communications, so communication
	theory can be generalized from a conventional time domain into both
	space and time domains. This article introduces a spatial and temporal
	communication theory based on an adaptive antenna array, such as
	spatial and temporal channel modeling, equalization, optimum detection
	for single-user and multi-user CDMA, precoding in a transmitter,
	and joint optimization of both transmitter and receiver. Such spatial

  abstract = {This paper studies self-organizing in a cellular radio network with
	dynamic channel assignment (DCA). Conceptually, channel assignment
	is split into two subsystems, one performing real- time assignment
	and one adjusting assignment probabilities, aiming to prefer selection
	of channels less affected by interference in the past. The latter
	subsystem is modeled by a differential equation. The resulting ??learning??
	network is able to perform phase transitions from a fully dynamic
	state in which all channels are used with equal probability to a
	state in which each cell prefers channels which are less frequently
	chosen by interfering cells. Both theoretical considerations and
	numerical simulations show that the simple strategy to avoid interference
	is generally unable to provide optimum channel reuse distances. The
	situation can be improved by refined learning strategies. Further
	numerical simulation of inhomogeneous networks indicates that channel
	reuse performance achieved by this strategy is reasonable, but still
	inferior to that of dedicated channel assignment algorithms},

	The underlying techniques exploit space diversity available through
	cooperating terminals' relaying signals for one another. We outline
	several strategies employed by the cooperating radios, including
	fixed relaying schemes such as amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward,
	selection relaying schemes that adapt based upon channel measurements
	between the cooperating terminals, and incremental relaying schemes
	that adapt based upon limited feedback from the destination terminal.
	We develop performance characterizations in terms of outage events
	and associated outage probabilities, which measure robustness of
	the transmissions to fading, focusing on the high signal-to-noise
	ratio (SNR) regime. Except for fixed decode-and-forward, all of our
	cooperative diversity protocols are efficient in the sense that they
	achieve full diversity (i.e., second-order diversity in the case
	of two terminals), and, moreover, are close to optimum (within 1.5
	dB) in certain regimes. Thus, using distributed antennas, we can
	provide the powerful benefits of space diversity without need for
	physical arrays, though at a loss of spectral efficiency due to half-duplex
	operation and possibly at the cost of additional receive hardware.
	Applicable to any wireless setting, including cellular or ad hoc
	networks-wherever space constraints preclude the use of physical
	arrays-the performance characterizations reveal that large power
	or energy savings result from the use of these protocols.},

	The use of universal frequency reuse can be said optimum in terms
	of the ergodic system spectral efficiency. However, it may cause
	inter-femtocell interference near the cell edge, making it difficult
	to serve the whole cell coverage. To alleviate this problem, we adjust
	the frequency reuse factor with the aid of femtocell location information.
	The proposed scheme can provide reasonably high ergodic system spectral
	efficiency, while assuring a desired performance near the cell boundary.
	Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is quite effective

	it enables multiple users to be served simultaneously in uplink as

	to maximize its objective (i.e. proportional fair criteria) in the
	frequency-domain setting. We show the NP-hardness of the frequency-domain

  abstract = {Future mobile communication systems demand much higher data rates
	which may require significantly more energy consumption, compared
	with the current 3G systems. Recently, green radio has attracted
	worldwide attention. Energy efficiency is considered as a very important
	factor for designing future communication systems in this green radio
	environment because reducing energy consumption of base stations
	(BSs) and mobile stations (MSs) can directly contribute to reducing
	CO2 emission. We investigate the effects of cell size on energy saving
	and system capacity and then show the effectiveness of small-cell
	based future mobile communication systems in terms of energy efficiency.
	If the path-loss exponent increases and cell-radius ratio becomes
	smaller, the per-energy capacity ratio becomes larger. For example,
	if the path-loss exponent is 4 and the per-energy capacity of a macro-cell
	is normalized to 1, the per-energy capacities of a micro, pico-,
	and femto-cell are 16,104, and 108 in downlink and 64,106, and 1012
	in uplink, respectively. The amount of CO2 emission of one BS transmitter
	is approximately 181[kg] in a year, if the cell radius is 1[km].
	If the cell radius is 500[m], 100[m], and 10[m], the amount of CO2

	We consider a large-scale of wireless networks whose nodes are distributed

	modeled by graph G(V,rn) in which two nodes are connected if their

	the resulted network can sustain k fault nodes with high probability.
	We show that, for a unit-area square region, the probability that
	the network G(V,rn) is (k+1)-connected is at least e-e- when the
	transmission radius rn satisfies n ? rn2 ? ln n + (2k-1)
	ln ln n -2ln k! + 2 for k>0 and n sufficiently large. This result

	handle the increasingly asymmetric traffic offered by current and

	asymmetries are required in different cells, inter-base station (IB)
	interference and inter-mobile (IM) interference arise. To keep the
	outage probability at a reasonable level this interference needs
	to be avoided. In a system with centralised resource allocation,
	information about IM link gains can be used to estimate IM interference.
	Measuring all IM link gains is often considered to be an intractable
	task. Thus, in this paper a simple method to estimate IM link gains
	and to avoid IM interference is proposed and evaluated. In a centralised

	divergences are learnt by minimizing the recognition error once a
	new feature is added to the classifier. This contrasts conventional
	AdaBoost where the coefficients are empirically set. Because of these

  abstract = {This paper investigates a hybrid space-time-division multiple access
	(S-TDMA) for broadband indoor wireless systems using sectored antennas.
	It is shown that portables which are located in different sectors
	of an indoor microcell may be able to reuse the same frequency and
	the same time slot. However, this requires careful scheduling of
	packet transmissions in order to avoid transmitting packets that
	would jam each other during the same time slot. It is proposed that
	the scheduling be performed in the base station, i.e., a central
	control architecture. The optimum scheduling algorithm, the one that
	maximizes the number of packets transmitted per frame, may be in
	the NP-complete class of problems, so it cannot be solved in real
	time. Therefore, a suboptimum algorithm, called the first fit algorithm
	(FFA), is proposed for frame scheduling. It was found that the capacity
	gain achieved by the FFA is dependent on the capture threshold, which
	is defined as the minimum signal-to- interference ratio required
	in order to achieve a given packet error rate goal. The capture threshold
	depends on the modulation and coding schemes. This paper investigates
	the performance of the FFA operating with multicarrier trellis- coded
	modulation. An alternative multicarrier modulation is analyzed, and
	the FFA performance is investigated when operating with the alternative
	and with the conventional multicarrier through computer simulations
	based on measured data which were obtained with a sectorization level
	of ten (using ten antenna sectors in the base station). The simulations
	have shown that the FFA can provide a large capacity gain when operating
	with multicarrier trellis-coded modulation and using differential
	detection. For example, while previous schemes can transmit only
	one packet at a time, the proposed scheme can transmit, on average,
	more than four packets per time slot in an open indoor location,
	or close to three packets per time slot in a closed indoor location
	with internal walls of concrete blocks},

	scheme for the uplink of 4G long-term evolution (LTE) systems. While
	universal frequency reuse (UFR) is being targeted for next generation

	LTE standard have proved that actual implementations of UFR in LTE
	lead to unacceptable interference levels experienced by user equipments
	near the cell edge area in a multi-cellular configuration. The herein
	proposed adaptive soft frequency reuse scheme is a step forward towards
	effective inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) in next-generation
	wireless networks. Our solution to the uplink ICIC problem stands
	out for its two essential features that consist of physical resource
	block (PRB) reuse avoidance/minimization and cell-edge bandwidth
	breathing which can be implemented at the cost of a negligible information
	exchange over the X2 interface (backbone). The PRB reuse avoidance
	feature significantly decreases inter-cell interference levels while
	improving the achievable average throughput per user, especially
	for those identified as cell-edge ones. The cell-edge bandwidth breathing
	strategy allows to track and adapt to semi-static changes in traffic
	loading and user distributions within each cell which drastically
	reduces the blocking probability of incoming calls under cell-edge

	in this paper for approximating the sum of independent or
	
	arbitrarily correlated lognormal random variables (RV) by a
	
	single lognormal RV. The method is also shown to be applicable
	
	for approximating the sum of lognormal-Rice and Suzuki RVs
	
	by a single lognormal RV. A sum consisting of a mixture of the
	
	above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses
	
	the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation
	
	and does so without the extremely precise numerical
	
	computations at a large number of points that were required by
	
	the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular
	
	approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method
	
	and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective
	
	short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric
	
	flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the
	
	lognormal sum distribution. The accuracy of the method is
	
	measured both visually, as has been done in the literature, as well
	
	as quantitatively, using curve-fitting metrics. An upper bound on
	
	the sensitivity of the method is also provided.},

  abstract = {Interchannel interference (ICI) is the key problem in wireless MIMO
	(multiple-input multiple-output) transmission. Numerous ICI reduction
	algorithms are reported in literature. It is common to these ICI
	reduction algorithms that they require considerable signal processing
	power. In this paper, a new approach is presented which avoids ICI
	and, thus, results in low complexity receivers whilst maintaining
	high spectral efficiency. It is demonstrated that this can be achieved
	for BPSK (binary phase shift keying) and QPSK (quadrature phase shift
	keying) modulation by compressing the symbols prior to transmission
	and by exploiting spatial information at the receiver. The V-BLAST
	(Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time) algorithm and simple, low
	complexity MMSE (minimum mean squared error) and zero-forcing (ZF)
	detection without ICI reduction was used for comparison. It is shown
	that the new MIMO approach outperforms V-BLAST by about 6.5 dB at
	a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 15 dB while it outperforms direct
	MMSE detection by about 12 dB. In addition, it was found that the
	spectral efficiency compared to SISO (single-input single-output)
	is improved by a factor of 4 at about the same bit-error performance},

	metric also provides a robust sync detection capability. Both time

	For FD training, maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio of
	the training symbol was taken into consideration. The channel estimation
	scheme based on the designed training symbol was also incorporated
	in the system in order to give both fine- timing and frequency-offset

	The first one is based on the suppression of the interference introduced
	in the frequency estimation process by the training symbol pattern
	in the context of multipath dispersive channels. The second one is
	based on the maximum likelihood principle and does not suffer from
	any interference. A new performance measure is introduced for timing
	estimation, which is based on the plot of signal to timing-error-induced
	average interference power ratio against the timing estimate shift.
	A simple approach for finding the optimal setting of the timing estimator

  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the intersection of personal wireless
	technology and computational intelligence. The primary research issue
	addressed is the organization of radio domain knowledge into data
	structures processable in real-time that integrate machine learning
	and natural language processing technology into software radio. The
	thesis defines and develops the cognitive radio architecture. The
	features needed in the architecture are derived from cognitive radio
	use cases. These include inferring user communications context, shaping
	accessnetwork demand, and realizing a protocol for real-time radio
	spectrum rental. Mathematical foundations for the knowledge-representation
	architecture are derived by applying point-set topology to the requirements
	of the use cases. This results in the set-theoretic ontology of radio
	knowledge defined in the Radio Knowledge Representation Language
	(RKRL). The mathematical analysis also demonstrates that isochronous
	radio software is not Turingcomputable. Instead, it is constrained
	to a bounded-recursive subset of the total functions. A rapid-prototype
	cognitive radio, CR1, was developed to apply these mathematical foundations
	in a simulated environment. CR1 demonstrated the principles of cognitive
	radio and focused the research issues. This led to an important contribution
	of this dissertation, the cognitive radio architecture. This is an
	open architecture framework for integrating agent-based control,
	natural language processing, and machine learning technology into
	software-defined radio platforms.},

	can also realize effective transmission power control with only the

	in CDMA/TDD for terminal size and battery life. This system is especially

	coherent bandwidth, and path diversity gain by itself is small},

	Already today discussion is starting on the development of systems

	today there is no clear vision available on such systems. This discussion
	takes into account the new deregulated and liberalized communication

	third- generation mobile radio systems, which comprises a combination
	of several optimized access systems in a common IP-based medium access
	and core network platform. These different access systems will interwork
	through horizontal and vertical handover, service negotiation, and
	global roaming. The different access systems are allocated to different
	mutually complementing cell layers in the sense of hierarchical cells
	with respect to cell size, coverage, and mobility to provide globally

	the implementation of multimode and multiband terminals and base

	of multiple-antenna systems to characterize the cooperative capacity

	regime, at a high SNR or with a large number of cooperating nodes,
	cooperative systems lack full multiplexing gain, in this paper we
	consider cooperative capacity gain at moderate SNR with a fixed number
	of cooperating antennas. We show that up to a lower bound to an SNR
	threshold, a cooperative system performs at least as well as a MIMO
	system with isotropic inputs; whereas beyond an upper bound to the
	SNR threshold, the cooperative system is limited by its coordination
	costs, and the capacity is strictly less than that of a MIMO orthogonal
	channel. The SNR threshold depends on the network geometry (the power
	gain g between the source and relay) and the number of cooperating
	antennas M; when the relay is close to the source (g ? 1), the SNR
	threshold lower and upper bounds are approximately equal. As the
	cooperating nodes are closer, i.e., as g increases, the MIMO-gain

	cancellation scheme for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal
	frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in the presence
	of intersymbol interference (ISI). The proposed channel estimation
	method uses special training sequences (TSs) to have a desirable
	crest-factor of the transmitted training signal, and to prevent the
	influence of ISI on the channel estimation performance. By using
	the recommended training sequences, the ill-conditioned problem of
	the least square (LS) filter integrated in the proposed channel estimator
	can be avoided. The proposed interference cancellation scheme uses
	the estimated channel coefficients and the channel state information
	(CSI) to reproduce the interference components, which are then iteratively
	cancelled from the received signals. To reduced the error-floor of
	the demodulated symbols using for the calculations of the interference
	components, the so-called remodulation technique is also included
	in the proposed interference cancellation scheme. Simulation results
	show that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms conventional
	channel estimation methods, especially in the presence of ISI and
	if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is larger than 15 dB. The combination
	of the proposed method with a space-time block code (STBC) to combat
	the interference influences results in an excellent system performance
	in terms of symbol error ratio (SER). In comparison with a STBC MIMO-OFDM
	system with sufficient guard interval (GI), this combination gains
	1.52 dB of SNR at the same SER of 1.1e-6 even after performing only
	one iteration of interference cancellation.},

  abstract = {The trend towards the third generation PCS (personal communications
	systems) calls for support of multimedia services in a multi- layered
	cell architecture system via multi-air interfaces with multi-operators
	and multi-services provider, offering a reliable and contiguous world-wide
	coverage in order to allow seamless roaming for subscribers. The
	coverage ranges from low speed, high user density environments such
	as the business sector to high speed, low user density open areas.
	It is realised that all users and operators' requirements can not
	be economically met by one system but through a combination and enhancements
	of existing fixed, cordless, cellular, satellite and data networks,
	which are designed around a specific set of services and environments.
	Clearly, there is a need for such systems to interwork together in
	a co-ordinated manner to satisfy three main requirements of the third
	generation PCS, i.e. coverage, mobility and service. Interworking
	between cordless, and cellular systems, e.g. DECT and GSM, is thoroughly
	investigated. The mobility related issues in the context of registration,
	location management and call routing are discussed. Then the signalling
	load issue in the interworking system is investigated and some new
	techniques are proposed to reduce the imposed signalling load on
	the cellular system's network},

	years. It has a wide variety of applications, including fraud detection
	and network intrusion detection. A good deal of research has been
	performed in this area, often using strings or attribute-value data
	as the medium from which anomalies are to be extracted. Little work,
	however, has focused on anomaly detection in graph-based data. In
	this paper, we introduce two techniques for graph-based anomaly detection.
	In addition, we introduce a new method for calculating the regularity
	of a graph, with applications to anomaly detection. We hypothesize
	that these methods will prove useful both for finding anomalies,
	and for determining the likelihood of successful anomaly detection
	within graph-based data. We provide experimental results using both
	real-world network intrusion data and artificially-created data.},

	on this comprehensive evaluation, a harmonized multiple access platform
	has been designed consisting of two modes: FMA1, a wideband TDMA
	with and without spreading and FMA2, a wideband CDMA. In general,
	both FMA1 and FMA2 can fulfil the UMTS objectives and form the FRAMES
	input into UMTS standardization. However, FMA1 seems more suitable
	for bursty types of traffic and in addition to FDD also for asymmetric
	TDD operation while FMA2 is better suited for moderately varying

  abstract = {Use of infrared light for indoor wireless communications has received
	considerable attention recently. In this paper, we present results
	obtained from a large set of measurements performed at the University
	of Ottawa. We investigate impacts of receiver rotation and shadowing
	on the properties of indoor infrared channels. This paper contains
	a description of a measurement system developed and used throughout
	the experiments. Measurement results are used to find and present
	methods to estimate variations of channel path loss for small changes
	in the receiver direction, using statistical techniques. This would
	be useful for generating samples of channel path loss for system
	performance simulations and modulation analysis. Using the measurement
	results, it is shown that variations of channel path loss are smooth
	and a simple curve-fitting algorithm can be used to accurately interpolate
	intermediate values. It is also shown that for a receiver changing
	its elevation angle from 0 to 180 , five points along the entire
	path are sufficient to predict variation of channel path loss for
	the entire rotation range. The results also demonstrate a correlation
	between the channel delay spread and channel path loss for both diffuse
	and line-of-sight configurations. A simple formula can provide an
	estimate of channel delay spread for a known path loss of a given
	configuration. It is demonstrated that variations of channel path
	loss for small changes of receiver rotation can be described by a
	Gamma distribution. This enables generation of samples of channel
	path loss under general conditions for system-level simulation algorithms.
	Measurements have also been performed to investigate effects of shadowing
	on indoor infrared channel characteristics. Some important parameters
	that specify the impact of shadowing on the channel characteristics
	are included in the measurement plans. Variations of channel path
	loss due to shadowing and due to these parameters are investigated
	and detailed results are reported. It is shown that shadowing affects
	the channel delay spread. For the measured shadowing results, it
	is shown that channel path loss and delay spread are correlated and
	their relationship is provided.},

	For interference cancellation, estimation of channel parameters (viz.
	received amplitude and phase) is important. We analyze a simple successive
	interference cancellation scheme for coherent BPSK modulation, where
	the parameter estimation is done using the output of a linear correlator.
	We then extend the analysis for a noncoherent modulation scheme,

	the correlator output. The performance of the IC scheme along with

	sets constraints on possible hopset adaptations. In this article

	the dynamics of spectrum usage as required by the current regulation.
	DAFH is a distributed mechanism by which collocated piconets select
	nonconflicting hopsets while trying to keep the hopset size as large

	algorithms proposed in literature are neither robust nor scalable.
	Several of these algorithms are unable to dynamically adjust to spatial
	and temporal fluctuations in channel demand (load). We present a
	distributed dynamic channel allocation (DCA) algorithm in which heavily
	loaded regions acquire a large number of communication channels,
	while their lightly loaded neighbors get assigned fewer channels.
	As the spatial distribution of channel demand changes with time,
	the spatial distribution of allocated channels adjusts accordingly.
	The algorithm described in this paper requires minimal involvement
	of the mobile nodes, thus conserving their limited energy supply.
	The algorithm is proved to be deadlock free, starvation free, and
	fair. It prevents cochannel interference and can tolerate the failure
	of mobile as well as static nodes without any significant degradation
	in service. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance
	of the proposed distributed dynamic algorithm is comparable to, and
	for some metrics, better than that of efficient centralized dynamic

	Adding to this problem is unbalanced traffic among the cells. Given
	the explosion of the wireless traffic, especially wireless data traffic
	for Internet/Web access, and limited spectrum available for licensing,
	congestion will occur in some cells, resulting in blocked new calls
	and dropped handoffs due to the lack of available data channels (or

  abstract = {Max-min fairness is widely used in various areas of networking. In
	every case where it is used, there is a proof of existence and one
	or several algorithms for computing it; in most, but not all cases,
	they are based on the notion of bottlenecks. In spite of this wide
	applicability, there are still examples, arising in the context of
	wireless or peer-to-peer networks, where the existing theories do
	not seem to apply directly. In this paper, we give a unifying treatment
	of max-min fairness, which encompasses all existing results in a
	simplifying framework, and extend its applicability to new examples.
	First, we observe that the existence of max-min fairness is actually
	a geometric property of the set of feasible allocations. There exist
	sets on which max-min fairness does not exist, and we describe a
	large class of sets on which a max-min fair allocation does exist.
	This class contains, but is not limited to the compact, convex sets
	of RN. Second, we give a general purpose centralized algorithm, called
	max-min programming, for computing the max-min fair allocation in
	all cases where it exists (whether the set of feasible allocations
	is in our class or not). Its complexity is of the order of N linear
	programming steps in RN, in the case where the feasible set is defined
	by linear constraints. We show that, if the set of feasible allocations
	has the free disposal property, then max-min programming reduces
	to a simpler algorithm, called water filling, whose complexity is
	much lower. Free disposal corresponds to the cases where a bottleneck
	argument can be made, and water filling is the general form of all
	previously known centralized algorithms for such cases. All our results
	apply mutatis mutandis to min-max fairness. Our results apply to
	weighted, unweighted and util-max-min and min-max fairness. Distributed
	algorithms for the computation of max-min fair allocations are outside
	the scope of this paper.},

	on providing improved throughput for cell or sector edge users that

  abstract = {Future multimedia services will require the transmission of very high
	data rates over broad-band radio channels. In order to provide these
	services to mobile users, an appropriate transmission technique has
	to cope with frequency-selective and time-variant radio channels.
	The computation complexity for an equalizer increases in a frequency-selective
	radio channel for high data rate applications. Furthermore, the overhead
	for channel estimation procedures increases in time-variant channels.
	To overcome these drawbacks orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
	(OFDM) has been considered for broadband applications in many publications.
	The objective of this paper is to describe the large potential, the
	flexibility and adaptivity of the OFDM transmission technique in
	frequency- selective and time variant radio channels. Several technical
	aspects of OFDM transmission systems are discussed, especially the
	topics of differential modulation for which we compare different
	demodulation methods and channel coding with soft decision decoding.
	For higher level differential modulation, multilevel coding is taken

  abstract = {Roaming for voice, the ability for a user to make and receive calls
	when visiting another country, is taken for granted by GSM users
	today. Currently GSM mobile operators are introducing packet-based
	data networks (also known as General Packet Radio Service) that bring
	a huge variety of services. However, this new network also introduces
	new complexity in the support of the packet-based roaming scenario.
	Due to the number of services, operators, and users envisaged, it
	will be impossible for operators to test all services for roaming
	in all partner networks for GPRS; instead, the capabilities of the
	network have to be tested. Furthermore, mobile data service developers
	must be aware that the network capabilities of a visited (GPRS) network
	might differ from the home network; thus, consideration is required
	to ensure service continuity. This is especially true as mobile operators
	start offering 3G networks and support roaming agreements from 3G
	to 2G networks. In the continuing development of the mobile network,
	3GPP (the international standardization body developing the UMTS
	standards) has defined the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) as an evolutionary
	path for basic 3G networks (developing on the already defined Release
	99 and Release 4 capabilities). The IMS provides an overlay architecture
	on top of the basic 3G architecture and implies roaming outside the
	basic 3G architecture. The resulting 3G-IMS network creates a two-layered
	roaming architecture, potentially resulting in issues related to
	optimal routing, QoS, and support of local services. The challenge
	for the industry cannot be pointed out as one difficult technical
	issue that needs to be solved to ensure 3G roaming. Instead there
	many smaller issues with many alternative solutions that need to
	be solved. Only when operators have a clear view of these issues
	and their roaming requirements can all issues be solved and roaming
	agreement negotiations run smoothly. As it looks today, it will be
	time consuming to establish and conclude the roaming agreements for
	3G; thus, delays in the roaming service are expected. When IMS arrives,
	new addendums will be needed to the roaming agreements, and the same
	risk for delays exists if the demand issues are not properly addressed
	before the ne- gotiations.},

	peer-to-peer and nonlocal traffic in a cellular-based time- division
	duplex code-division multiple-access (TDD-CDMA) system known as opportunity
	driven multiple access (ODMA). The key to offering appropriate performance
	of peer-to-peer communication in such a system relies on the use
	of a routing algorithm which minimizes interference. This paper presents
	a study of the constraints and limitations on the capacity of such
	a system using a variety of routing techniques. A congestion-based
	routing algorithm is presented that attempts to minimize the overall
	power of the system as well as providing a measure of feasibility.
	This technique provides the lowest required transmit power in all
	circumstances, and the highest capacity in nearly all cases studied.
	All of the routing algorithms studied here allocate TDD time slots
	on a first come first served basis according to a set of predefined
	rules. This fact is utilized to enable the development of a combined
	routing and resource allocation algorithm for TDD-CDMA relaying.
	A novel method of time slot allocation according to relaying requirements
	is then developed. Two measures of assessing congestion are presented
	based on matrix norms. One is suitable for current interior point
	solution, the other is more elegant but is not currently suitable
	for efficient minimization and, thus, practical implementation.},

  abstract = {The idea of implementing an indoor radio communications system serving
	an entire building from a single central antenna appears to be an
	attractive proposition. However, based on various indoor propagation
	measurements of the signal attenuation and the multipath delay spread,
	such a centralized approach appears to be limited to small buildings
	and to narrow-band FDMA-type systems with limited reliability and
	flexibility. In this paper, we present the results of indoor radio
	propagation measurements of two signal distribution approaches that
	improve the picture dramatically. In the first, the building is divided
	into many small cells, each served from an antenna located in its
	own center, and with adjacent cells operating in different frequency
	bands. In the second approach, the building is divided into one or
	more large cells, each served from a distributed antenna system or
	a "leaky feeder" that winds its way through the hallways. This approach
	eliminates the frequency cell handoff problem that is bound to exist
	in the first approach, while still preserving the dramatic reductions
	in multipath delay spread and signal attenuation compared to a centralized
	system. For example, the measurements show that, with either approach,
	the signal attenuation can be reduced by as much as a few tens of
	decibels and the rms delay spread becomes limited to 20 to 50 us,
	even in large buildings. This can make possible the implementation
	of sophisticated broad- band TDMA-type systems that are flexible,
	robust, and virtually building-independent.},

	concept that is applicable to both multiuser communications and single-user

	using a hybrid multiple access scheme based on a combination of time-division
	multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA).
	Next, we extend it to full CDMA by defining two sets of orthogonal
	signal waveforms. Using a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation,
	it is shown that this multiple access concept can increase the number
	of users by 40\% with respect to the hard limit of orthogonal waveform
	multiple access (OWMA) which includes TDMA, orthogonal CDMA (OCDMA),
	and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Then,
	we apply the same concept to single-user communications to transmit
	an excess bit rate in addition to the primary data rate. It is shown
	that an excess data rate of up to 25\% can be transmitted at the
	price of a very small penalty in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)},

  abstract = {Multiple access techniques which allow a communication medium to be
	shared between different users represent one of the most challenging
	topics in digital communications. In terms of the number of users
	that can be accommodated on a given channel, there are two distinct
	classes of multiple access techniques. The first class includes the
	well-known FDMA, TDMA, and OCDMA. On a channel whose bandwidth is
	N times the bandwidth of the individual user signals, these techniques
	can accommodate N users without any mutual interference, but not
	a single additional user can be supported beyond this limiting number.
	The second class includes CDMA with pseudo-noise spreading sequences
	(which we refer to as PN-CDMA) and some other related schemes. PN-CDMA
	does not have a hard limit on the number of users that can be accommodated,
	but is subject to multi-user interference which grows linearly with
	the number of users. In this article, after reviewing the capacity
	limits of existing multiple access techniques, we describe some newly
	introduced concepts which allow us to accommodate N users without
	any interference while also accommodating additional users at the
	expense of some SNR penalty},

	of the received power can be measured by rotating the antenna beam
	around the 360-degree field of view. This spatial spectrum can be
	used by a single receiver as a mean for estimating the position of
	a mobile transmitter. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility
	of this methodology, and show the improvement achieved in the positioning

	random coding and typical-set decoding. Then, we study the performance
	of low-density parity- check (LDPC) code ensembles with iterative
	belief-propagation decoding, and show that, under the hypothesis
	of infinite- length codes, LDPCs yield almost optimal performance.
	Unfortunately, standard finite-length LDPC ensembles incur a considerable
	performance loss with respect to their infinite- length counterpart,
	because of their poor frame-error rate (FER) performance. In order
	to recover part of this loss, we propose two simple yet effective
	methods: using a modified LDPC ensemble designed to improve the FER;
	and using an outer selective-repeat protocol acting on smaller packets
	of information bits. Surprisingly, these apparently very different
	methods yield almost the same performance gain and recover a considerable
	fraction of the optimal throughput, thus making practical finite-length
	LDPC codes very attractive for data wireless communications based
	on IR H-ARQ schemes.},

	generally derive a speed estimate based on the statistics of the

	in mobile-user velocity estimation is that of the frequency reference
	at the receiver. Velocity estimators require a precise frequency
	reference to detect small changes in frequency or phase shift that
	are caused by the motion of the user. The oscillators that are used
	in communication equipment typically have tolerances in the same
	range as the expected Doppler shifts. Without a precise frequency
	reference at the receiver, the carrier recovery loop tracks the received
	carrier frequency which may have been subjected to a frequency shift.
	In the most general case, the scattering environment is also unknown.
	To resolve these problems of precision and ambiguity in the Doppler
	spectrum, a closed-loop measurement between transmitter and receiver
	must be performed. The paper introduces a closed-loop Doppler measurement

	CDMA-like systems (as the physical channel is) rather than assigned
	physical channel schemes (referred to as circuit switched) are required
	to support this bandwidth-on-demand environment. There are two essential
	concepts beyond 3G. One of these is the provision of data transmission
	at rates of 100 Mb/s while mobile and 1 Gb/s while stationary. The

  abstract = {This paper examines near-capacity dirty-paper code designs based on
	source-channel coding. We first point out that the performance loss
	in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in our code designs can be broken
	into the sum of the packing loss from channel coding and a modulo
	loss, which is a function of the granular loss from source coding
	and the target dirty-paper coding rate (or SNR). We then examine
	practical designs by combining trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) with
	both systematic and nonsystematic irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA)
	codes. Like previous approaches, we exploit the extrinsic information
	transfer (EXIT) chart technique for capacity-approaching IRA code
	design; but unlike previous approaches, we emphasize the role of
	strong source coding to achieve as much granular gain as possible
	using TCQ. Instead of systematic doping, we employ two relatively
	shifted TCQ codebooks, where the shift is optimized (via tuning the
	EXIT charts) to facilitate the IRA code design. Our designs synergistically
	combine TCQ with IRA codes so that they work together as well as
	they do individually. By bringing together TCQ (the best quantizer
	from the source coding community) and EXIT chart-based IRA code designs
	(the best from the channel coding community), we are able to approach
	the theoretical limit of dirty-paper coding. For example, at 0.25
	bit per symbol (b/s), our best code design (with 2048-state TCQ)
	performs only 0.630 dB away from the Shannon capacity.},

	of spectral resources in the frequency band of licensed (primary)
	systems. Secondary usage of licensed spectrum is being considered
	as a viable solution to the problem of inefficient usage of spectral
	resources. In this paper, we model and analyze the performance of
	the secondary system in dynamic spectrum access by secondary users
	employing an overlay approach of sharing spectral resources with
	a primary system. Our model assumes the operation of primary system
	is completely unaffected by the introduction of a secondary system,
	i.e., primary users have priority in transmission over secondary
	users. Each primary user is randomly assigned an available frequency
	slot for transmission by the primary system controller. Secondary
	users are required to sense across the same spectrum to identify
	any unoccupied frequency slots for transmission. During its transmission,
	if it detects a primary user accessing the same frequency slot, the
	connection will be forced to drop. Using a three-dimension Markov
	chain model, this paper presents an analytical approach to study
	the secondary system performance under a given primary traffic. Two
	important parameters that are indicative of the grade-of-service
	(GoS) of the secondary system, namely, secondary call blocking probability
	and secondary call dropping probability are computed using the model
	presented. The analysis provides an insightful study about how the
	secondary system capacity is determined by its GoS requirement. We
	use the same analytical approach to show that when the secondary
	call dropping probability is the cause of low capacity, by suitably
	reserving a number of frequency slots for primary users' access,
	the secondary system capacity can be improved significantly},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the major cause of death amongst women in the 35
	to 55 age group. Mammography is the only feasible imaging modality
	for screening large numbers of women. With the present screening
	policy, there are three million mammograms to be analysed each year
	in the UK; there is therefore a need (as yet unmet) for an automated
	analysis system which could highlight areas of interest. In the first
	instance, the areas of interest might simply be any mass-like structures
	and this is indeed the approach reported on in this paper. Mammography
	is typical of many problems in medicine: the class of real interest
	is under-represented in the database of available examples and hence
	its prior probability will be very low. As a result of this, there
	are very few examples of abnormalities in any of the existing databases.
	If a neural network classifier is trained using the standard approach
	of minimising the mean-squared error (MSE) at the output, the under-represented
	class will be ignored. We have been exploring an alternative approach
	in which we attempt to learn a description of normality using the
	large number of available mammograms which do not show any evidence
	of mass-like structures. The idea is then to test for novelty against
	this description in order to try and identify candidate masses in
	previously unseen images analysis and interpretation and present
	a sample of the results which we have so far obtained on a standard
	database.},

	algorithm which is based only on linear processing at the receiver.
	We review the encoding and decoding algorithms for various codes

  abstract = {The wireless mesh network has been an emerging technology in recent
	years. Because the transmission medium used in networking backhaul
	APs is radio, the wireless mesh network is not only easy and cost
	effective in deployment, but also has good scalability in coverage
	area and capacity. The IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol has been adopted
	as the de-facto medium access control. In this paper, we assess the
	fitness of the IEEE 802.11 over wireless mesh networks. We focus
	on the question: Does the backhaul networking of a wireless mesh
	network have the capability to support multimedia transport? The
	backhaul must guarantee the throughput and the latency. Furthermore,
	the QoS guarantee is required for multimedia applications. We contend
	that it is really necessary to consider what the key is to be changed
	in the IEEE 802.11 so that it can adapt the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol
	to wireless mesh networks. Through the study of existing solutions,

  abstract = {Two major technical challenges in the design of future broadband wireless
	networks are the impairments of the propagation channel and the need
	for spectral efficiency. To mitigate the channel impairments, orthogonal
	frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used, which transforms
	a frequency-selective channel in a set of frequency-flat channels.
	On the other hand, to achieve higher spectral efficiency, space division
	multiple access (SDMA) can be used, which reuses bandwidth by multiplexing
	signals based on their spatial signature. In this paper, we present
	a combined OFDM/SDMA approach that couples the capabilities of the
	two techniques to tackle both challenges at once. We propose four
	algorithms, ranging from a low-complexity linear minimum mean squared
	error (MMSE) solution to the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector.
	By applying per-carrier successive interference cancellation (pcSIC),
	initially proposed for DS-CDMA, and introducing selective state insertion
	(SI), we achieve a good tradeoff between performance and complexity.
	A case study demonstrates that, compared to the MMSE approach, our
	pcSIC-SI-OFDM/SDMA algorithm obtains a performance gain of 10 dB
	for a BER of 10-3, while it is only three times more complex. On
	the other hand, it is two orders of magnitude less complex than the
	ML approach, for a performance penalty of only 2 dB},

  abstract = {In this paper, the effect of variation in the spatial protection margin,
	is investigated for multihop wireless networks under the interference
	avoidance Protocol Model [1] and compared to single-hop communication
	network. Under the Protocol Model, the interference is avoided by
	the application of the exclusion range concept. This means that a
	spatial protection region (or a circular exclusion region) is specified
	around all receiving nodes so that any node other than the intended
	transmitter is not allowed to reuse the same frequency resource within
	this region. It is demonstrated that for an asymptotically infinite
	coverage area, the spatial reuse efficiency for a multihop design
	increases proportionally with the number of multiple hops per link,
	and with the spatial protection margin. However, under a finite coverage
	area, the monotonic increase of spatial reuse efficiency does not
	remain completely valid. In order to analyze the performance of such
	a system, a relation for the system throughput is derived from the
	Shannon capacity equation. It is found that the system throughput
	attains a peak when the value of spatial protection margin is nearly
	unity. The exact value of spatial protection margin when the throughput
	reaches its maximum is found to be a monotonically increasing function
	of the number of multiple hops and the pathloss exponent.},

	the results to the complex version of the problem and using the expected
	complexity expressions to determine situations where sphere decoding
	is practically feasible. In particular, we consider applications
	of sphere decoding to detection in multiantenna systems. We show
	that, for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), rates, and
	numbers of antennas, the expected complexity is polynomial, in fact,
	often roughly cubic. Since many communications systems operate at
	noise levels for which the expected complexity turns out to be polynomial,
	this suggests that maximum-likelihood decoding, which was hitherto
	thought to be computationally intractable, can, in fact, be implemented
	in real-time-a result with many practical implications. To provide
	complexity information beyond the mean, we derive a closed-form expression
	for the variance of the complexity of sphere-decoding algorithm in
	a finite lattice. Furthermore, we consider the expected complexity
	of sphere decoding for channels with memory, where the lattice-generating

	Our work proposes an approach to extract temporal patterns from data

	Our problem formulation exhibits two major challenges: 1) we assume
	events being characterized by categorical features and displaying
	uneven inter-arrival times; such an assumption falls outside the
	scope of classical time-series analysis, 2) we assume target events
	are highly infrequent; predictive techniques must deal with the class-imbalance
	problem. We propose an efficient algorithm that tackles the challenges
	above by transforming the event prediction problem into a search
	for all frequent eventsets preceding target events. The class imbalance
	problem is overcome by a search for patterns on the minority class
	exclusively; the discrimination power of patterns is then validated
	against other classes. Patterns are then combined into a rule-based
	model for prediction. Our experimental analysis indicates the types

	since the conventional AMPS/TDMA frequency planning is not required,

	sectorization scheme for a CDMA base station to provide higher capacity.
	Multiple carriers deployment provides another option. From a capacity
	standpoint, even an un-orchestrated multiple carriers deployment
	multiplies the capacity of the network. With an intelligent resource
	allocation scheme, the traffic loading among multiple carriers can
	be intelligently managed to increase the trunking efficiency of the

	Various multiple access schemes based on time- division and packet

	capabilities, sensitivity to speech packet dropping, delay, robustness
	to lossy packet environments, and overhead efficiency. In particular,
	a low- delay multiple access scheme, called shared time-division
	duplexing (STDD) is proposed. This scheme allows both the uplink
	and downlink traffic to share a common channel, thereby achieving
	high statistical multiplexing gain even with a low population of
	simultaneous conversations. The authors also propose a choice of
	low delay, high quality speech coding and digital modulation systems
	based on adaptive DPCM, with QDPSK or pseudo-analog transmission
	(skewed DPSK), for use in conjunction with the STDD multiple access
	protocol. The choice of the alternative systems depends on required
	end-to-end delay, recovered speech quality and bandwidth efficiency.

	in hierarchical cellular systems. The proposed algorithm is based
	on normalized autocorrelation values of received signals to estimate
	mobile speed; it contains six steps. First, the instantaneous power
	of the received baseband signal is calculated to remove the frequency
	offset and data/speech information-bearing signals, while keeping
	the Doppler frequency information. Second, the calculated power signal
	is filtered using a low-pass linear phase finite impulse response
	filter to suppress interference and noise. Third, the filtered power
	signal is decimated to ease the computational burden, while the decimation
	factor is properly chosen to avoid frequency aliasing. Fourth, autocorrelation
	values of the decimated filtered power signals are calculated on
	shifting slot by slot to suppress the "slot burst frequency" interference.
	Fifth, the calculated autocorrelation values are normalized to suppress
	the power fluctuation of the received signals. Finally, the normalized
	autocorrelation values are compared with thresholds to estimate mobile
	speed. The simulation results indicate that the new algorithm works
	very well for both nondispersive channels and dispersive channels
	to distinguish fast and slow moving mobiles. The method has very
	low latency, with results being available typically within 1 s after

  abstract = {Spectrum is one of the most precious radio resources. With the increasing
	demand for wireless communication, efficiently using the spectrum
	resource has become an essential issue. With the Federal Communications
	Commission's (FCC) spectrum policy reform, secondary spectrum sharing
	has gained increasing interest. One of the policy reforms introduces
	the concept of an interference temperature - the total allowable
	interference in a spectral band. This means that secondary users
	can use different transmit powers as long as the sum of these power
	is less than the interference threshold. In this paper, we study
	two problems in secondary spectrum access with minimum signal to
	interference noise ratio (quality of service (QoS)) guarantee under
	an interference temperature constraint. First, when all the secondary
	links can be supported, a nonlinear optimization problem with the
	objective to maximize the total transmitting rate of the secondary
	users is formulated. The nonlinear optimization is solved efficiently
	using geometric programming techniques. The second problem we address
	is, when not all the secondary links can be supported with their
	QoS requirement, it is desirable to have the spectrum access opportunity
	proportional to the user priority if they belong to different priority
	classes. In this context, we formulate an operator problem which
	takes the priority issues into consideration. To solve this problem,
	first, we propose a centralized reduced complexity search algorithm
	to find the optimal solution. Then, in order to solve this problem
	distributively, we define a secondary spectrum sharing potential
	game. The Nash equilibria of this potential game are investigated.
	The efficiency of the Nash equilibria solutions are characterized.
	It is shown that distributed sequential play and an algorithm based
	on stochastic learning attain the equilibrium solutions. Finally,
	the performances are examined through simulations},

	physical carrier sensing and RTS/CTS handshake (also known as "virtual
	carrier sensing"). Ideally, the RTS/CTS handshake can eliminate most
	interference. However, the effectiveness of RTS/CTS handshake is
	based on the assumption that hidden nodes are within transmission
	range of receivers. In this paper, we prove using analytic models
	that in ad hoc networks, such an assumption cannot hold due to the
	fact that power needed for interrupting a packet reception is much
	lower than that of delivering a packet successfully. Thus, the "virtual
	carrier sensing" implemented by RTS/CTS handshake cannot prevent
	all interference. Physical carrier sensing can complement this in
	some degree. However, since interference happens at receivers, while
	physical carrier sensing is detecting transmitters (the same problem
	causing the hidden terminal situation), physical carrier sensing
	cannot help much, unless a very large carrier sensing range is adopted,
	which is limited by the antenna sensitivity. We investigate how effective
	is the RTS/CTS handshake in terms of reducing interference. We show
	that in some situations, the interference range is much larger than
	transmission range, where RTS/CTS cannot function well. Then, a simple
	MAC layer scheme is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results
	verify that our scheme can help IEEE 802.11 resolve most interference
	caused by large interference range.},

	The intrinsic property of OFDM ensures that it can be used in a multiuser
	application to produce a highly flexible and cost- efficient communication
	system. In particular, the FDMA technique in combination with OFDM
	(OFDMA) is assumed in this paper. This allows for a high degree of
	bit-granularity, which is desirable for packet data services. In
	the past, the performance of such an air-interface was primarily
	investigated for a single cell scenario (hot spot). In this investigation
	the performance of OFDMA in a cellular environment with frequency
	reuse of one and non-perfect frequency synchronization is investigated.
	In particular the effects of co-channel interference (CCI) in the
	uplink is analysed since primarily this link direction is affected
	by asynchronous transmissions. Two kinds of power control methods
	have been implemented in this paper in order to combat the CCI and
	improve the spectrum efficiency. One is constant received power control
	(CRPC); the other is step removal algorithm C/I balancing power control
	(SRAPC). The performance measure is outage. The results show that
	outage probability is significant (up to 55\%) for a two-cell case

	In this paper, we consider a low mobility, wireless OFDM cellular
	system. Since a cellular system uses a frequency reuse concept to
	enhance the efficiency of spectral utilization, it introduces so
	called cochannel interference (CCI) which is one of the major sources
	of performance degradation. To mitigate the effect of CCI while satisfying
	required quality of service, the power level of each subchannel of
	the OFDM system should be allocated to and controlled at an optimal
	value such that the system throughput can be maximized by employing
	adaptive modulation. Due to the effect of the CCI in the multi-cell
	OFDM system, the optimal values of power levels are very difficult
	to find. A new distributed suboptimal power allocation algorithm
	for the multi-cell OFDM system is proposed to increase the system

	channel non-reciprocity problem). This allows the scheduling of BS
	made in the beginning of DL frame to be valid for the whole DL frame

  abstract = { Optimal transmitter designs obeying the water-filling principle are
	well-documented; they are widely applied when the propagation channel
	is deterministically known and regularly updated at the transmitter.
	Because channel state information is impossible to be known perfectly
	at the transmitter in practical wireless systems, we design, in this
	paper, an optimal multiantenna transmitter based on the knowledge
	of mean values of the underlying channels. Our optimal transmitter
	design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing
	to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the correlation
	matrix of the estimated channel at the transmitter and with proper
	power loading across beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing
	an upper bound on the symbol error rate, which leads to better performance
	than maximizing the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.
	Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-directional eigen-beamforming
	emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-directional
	beamforming with uniformly improved performance, without rate reduction,
	and without essential increase in complexity. With multiple receive
	antennas and reasonably good feedback quality, the two-directional
	eigen-beamformer is also capable of achieving the best possible performance
	in a large range of transmit-power-to-noise ratios, without a rate
	penalty.},
