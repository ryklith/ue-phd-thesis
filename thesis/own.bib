  abstract = {We consider single cell multi-user OFDMA downlink resource allocation
	on a flat-fading channel such that average supply power is minimized
	while fulfilling a set of target rates. Available degrees of freedom
	are transmission power and duration. This paper extends our previous
	work on power optimal resource allocation in the mobile downlink
	by detailing the optimal power control strategy investigation and
	extracting fundamental characteristics of power optimal operation
	in cellular downlink. We find that only a system wide allocation
	of transmit powers is optimal rather than on link level. The allocation
	strategy that minimizes overall power consumption requires the transmission
	power on all links to be increased if only one link degrades. Furthermore,
	we show that for mobile stations with equal channels but different
	rate requirements, it is power optimal to assign equal transmit powers
	with proportional transmit durations. To relate the effectiveness
	of power control to live operation, we take the power model into
	consideration which maps transmit power to supply power. We show
	that due to the affine mapping, the solution is independent of the
	power model. However, the effectiveness of power control measures
	is completely dependent on the underlying hardware and the load dependence
	factor of a base station (instead of absolute consumption values).
	Finally, we conclude that power control measures in base stations
	are most relevant in macro stations which have load dependence factor
	of more than 50%.},
