  abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of an uplink interference protection
	(ULIP) mechanism in a two-cell scenario with full frequency reuse.
	Uplink (UL) interference from neighbouring cells can be mitigated
	by reducing the transmit power of cochannel interfering mobile stations
	(MSs). This is done based on the target signal-to-noise-plus-interference
	ratio (SINR) and tolerable interference of the vulnerable link. Upon
	reduction of the transmit power, SINR and consequently, capacity
	gains are achieved. Priority bands are used to differentiate those
	MSs that are to be protected from interference and those that are
	required to sacrifice transmission power to facilitate the protection.
	Furthermore, a scheduling scheme is suggested in which a fair allocation
	of priority and non-priority resource blocks (RBs) attempts to enhance
	the throughput gains acquired through ULIP. This work shows that,
	in terms of achieved throughput, for a loss of approximately 25%
	for non-priority MSs, a gain of up to 65% is made available to priority
	MSs. Furthermore, since ULIP makes use of already existing Long-Term
	Evolution (LTE) signalling techniques, only minimal signalling overhead

	multiple access (OFDMA) operating in time division duplex (TDD) cellular

	a victim receiver is established, whose size is determined by a threshold

  abstract = {In this paper a novel decentralized and interference aware medium
	access control (MAC) protocol combined with a dynamic subchannel
	selection algorithm for OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)
	is presented. The protocol resolves several drawbacks of the existing
	radio resource allocation techniques for OFDM systems, such as the
	hidden and exposed node problem, and the requirement for a time-invariant
	channel. The proposed scheme enables the transmitter to determine
	the level of interference it would cause to already active links
	prior to any transmission. This is achieved through a busyslot signaling
	that exploits the channel reciprocity offered by the TDD mode. Compared
	to existing radio resource allocation schemes the required signaling
	overhead is significantly reduced. The interference awareness allows
	the system to avoid significant co-channel interference (CCI) and
	to operate with full frequency reuse. When applied to a broadband
	OFDM air interface, this principle can also exploit the frequency
	selective fading channel on the intended as well as the interference
	links. This results in an autonomous subcarrier allocation algorithm
	which can dynamically adapt to time- varying channels. Due to its
	decentralized nature, the algorithm can be utilized in both cellular
	and ad hoc networks. Simulation results for a cellular system show
	that the new decentralized medium access and channel assignment algorithm
	is capable of achieving spectral efficiencies of up to 2.25 bits/Hz/cell

	work on power optimal resource allocation in the mobile downlink
	by detailing the optimal power control strategy investigation and
	extracting fundamental characteristics of power optimal operation
	in cellular downlink. We find that only a system wide allocation
	of transmit powers is optimal rather than on link level. The allocation
	strategy that minimizes overall power consumption requires the transmission
	power on all links to be increased if only one link degrades. Furthermore,
	we show that for mobile stations with equal channels but different
	rate requirements, it is power optimal to assign equal transmit powers
	with proportional transmit durations. To relate the effectiveness
	of power control to live operation, we take the power model into
	consideration which maps transmit power to supply power. We show
	that due to the affine mapping, the solution is independent of the
	power model. However, the effectiveness of power control measures
	is completely dependent on the underlying hardware and the load dependence
	factor of a base station (instead of absolute consumption values).
	Finally, we conclude that power control measures in base stations
	are most relevant in macro stations which have load dependence factor

  abstract = {This article presents a biologically-inspired approach for distributed
	slot synchronization in wireless networks. This is facilitated by
	modifying and extending a synchronization model based on the theory
	of pulse-coupled oscillators. The proposed Meshed Emergent Firefly
	Synchronization (MEMFIS) multiplexes synchronization words with data
	packets and adapts local clocks upon the reception of synchronization
	words from neighboring nodes. In this way, a dedicated synchronization
	phase is mitigated, as a network-wide slot structure emerges seamlessly
	over time as nodes exchange data packets. Simulation results demonstrate
	that synchronization is accomplished regardless of the arbitrary
	initial situation. There is no need for the selection of master nodes,
	as all nodes cooperate in a completely self-organized manner to achieve
	slot synchrony. Moreover, the algorithm is shown to scale with the
	number of nodes, works in meshed networks, and is robust against
	interference and collisions in dense networks.},

	networks is presented. The algorithm is derived from a model describing
	synchronization phenomena in biological self- organized systems.
	Constraints in a wireless environment, such as the fact that a node
	cannot receive and transmit simultaneously (deafness), the duration
	of a synchronization message and the delay required at the receiver
	to decode this message, are taken into account. When applied to meshed
	networks where nodes have few neighbors, deafness becomes problematic.
	That is, nodes which are transmitting cannot receive messages, an
	effect which becomes increasingly severe as the number of neighboring
	nodes decreases. We propose a delay tolerant synchronization scheme
	which retains high synchronization rates even in difficult network
	topologies, with an accuracy only limited by propagation delays},
